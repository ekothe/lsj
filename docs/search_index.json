The book discusses how to get started in jamovi as well as giving an introduction to data manipulation. From a statistical perspective, the book discusses descriptive statistics and graphing first, followed by chapters on probability theory, sampling and estimation, and null hypothesis testing. After introducing the theory, the book covers the analysis of contingency tables, correlation, \\(t\\)-tests, regression, ANOVA and factor analysis. Bayesian statistics are covered at the end of the book.

In the ANOVA chapters we have added sections on repeated measures ANOVA and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). In a new chapter we have introduced Factor Analysis and related techniques. Hopefully the style of this new material is consistent with the rest of the book, though eagle-eyed readers might spot a bit more of an emphasis on conceptual and practical explanations, and a bit less algebra. Im not sure this is a good thing, and might add the algebra in a bit later. But it reflects both my approach to understanding and teaching statistics, and also some feedback I have received from students on a course I teach. In line with this, I have also been through the rest of the book and tried to separate out some of the algebra by putting it into a box or frame. Its not that this stuff is not important or useful, but for some students they may wish to skip over it and therefore the boxing of these parts should help some readers. With this version I am very grateful to comments and feedback received from my students and colleagues, notably Wakefield Morys-Carter, and also to numerous people all over the world who have sent in small suggestions and corrections - much appreciated, and keep them coming! One pretty neat new feature is that the example data files for the book can now be loaded into jamovi as an add-on module - thanks to Jonathon Love for helping with that. David Foxcroft February 1st, 2019 0.2 Preface to Version 0.65 In this adaptation of the excellent `Learning statistics with R, by Danielle Navarro, we have replaced the statistical software used for the analyses and examples with jamovi. Although R is a powerful statistical programming language, it is not the first choice for every instructor and student at the beginning of their statistical learning. Some instructors and students tend to prefer the point-and-click style of software, and thats where jamovi comes in. jamovi is software that aims to simplify two aspects of using R. It offers a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), and it also provides functions that combine the capabilities of many others, bringing a more SPSS- or SAS-like method of programming to R. Importantly, jamovi will always be free and open - thats one of its core values - because jamovi is made by the scientific community, for the scientific community. With this version I am very grateful for the help of others who have read through drafts and provided excellent suggestions and corrections, particularly Dr David Emery and Kirsty Walter. David Foxcroft July 1st, 2018 0.3 Preface to Version 0.6 The book hasnt changed much since 2015 when I released Version 0.5  its probably fair to say that Ive changed more than it has. I moved from Adelaide to Sydney in 2016 and my teaching profile at UNSW is different to what it was at Adelaide, and I havent really had a chance to work on it since arriving here! Its a little strange looking back at this actually. A few quick comments Weirdly, the book consistently misgenders me, but I suppose I have only myself to blame for that one :-) Theres now a brief footnote on page 12 that mentions this issue; in real life Ive been working through a gender affirmation process for the last two years and mostly go by she/her pronouns. I am, however, just as lazy as I ever was so I havent bothered updating the text in the book. For Version 0.6 I havent changed much Ive made a few minor changes when people have pointed out typos or other errors. In particular its worth noting the issue associated with the etaSquared function in the lsr package (which isnt really being maintained any more) in Section 14.4. The function works fine for the simple examples in the book, but there are definitely bugs in there that I havent found time to check! So please take care with that one. The biggest change really is the licensing! Ive released it under a Creative Commons licence (CC BY-SA 4.0, specifically), and placed all the source files to the associated GitHub repository, if anyone wants to adapt it. Maybe someone would like to write a version that makes use of the tidyverse I hear thats become rather important to R these days :-) Best, Danielle Navarro 0.4 Preface to Version 0.5 Another year, another update. This time around, the update has focused almost entirely on the theory sections of the book. Chapters 9, 10 and 11 have been rewritten, hopefully for the better. Along the same lines, Chapter 17 is entirely new, and focuses on Bayesian statistics. I think the changes have improved the book a great deal. Ive always felt uncomfortable about the fact that all the inferential statistics in the book are presented from an orthodox perspective, even though I almost always present Bayesian data analyses in my own work. Now that Ive managed to squeeze Bayesian methods into the book somewhere, Im starting to feel better about the book as a whole. I wanted to get a few other things done in this update, but as usual Im running into teaching deadlines, so the update has to go out the way it is! Dan Navarro February 16, 2015 0.5 Preface to Version 0.4 A year has gone by since I wrote the last preface. The book has changed in a few important ways: Chapters 3 and 4 do a better job of documenting some of the time saving features of Rstudio, Chapters 12 and 13 now make use of new functions in the lsr package for running chi-square tests and t tests, and the discussion of correlations has been adapted to refer to the new functions in the lsr package. The soft copy of 0.4 now has better internal referencing (i.e., actual hyperlinks between sections), though that was introduced in 0.3.1. Theres a few tweaks here and there, and many typo corrections (thank you to everyone who pointed out typos!), but overall 0.4 isnt massively different from 0.3. I wish Id had more time over the last 12 months to add more content. The absence of any discussion of repeated measures ANOVA and mixed models more generally really does annoy me. My excuse for this lack of progress is that my second child was born at the start of 2013, and so I spent most of last year just trying to keep my head above water. As a consequence, unpaid side projects like this book got sidelined in favour of things that actually pay my salary! Things are a little calmer now, so with any luck version 0.5 will be a bigger step forward. One thing that has surprised me is the number of downloads the book gets. I finally got some basic tracking information from the website a couple of months ago, and (after excluding obvious robots) the book has been averaging about 90 downloads per day. Thats encouraging: theres at least a few people who find the book useful! Dan Navarro February 4, 2014 0.6 Preface to Version 0.3 Theres a part of me that really doesnt want to publish this book. Its not finished. And when I say that, I mean it. The referencing is spotty at best, the chapter summaries are just lists of section titles, theres no index, there are no exercises for the reader, the organisation is suboptimal, and the coverage of topics is just not comprehensive enough for my liking. Additionally, there are sections with content that Im not happy with, figures that really need to be redrawn, and Ive had almost no time to hunt down inconsistencies, typos, or errors. In other words, this book is not finished. If I didnt have a looming teaching deadline and a baby due in a few weeks, I really wouldnt be making this available at all. What this means is that if you are an academic looking for teaching materials, a Ph.D. student looking to learn R, or just a member of the general public interested in statistics, I would advise you to be cautious. What youre looking at is a first draft, and it may not serve your purposes. If we were living in the days when publishing was expensive and the internet wasnt around, I would never consider releasing a book in this form. The thought of someong shelling out $80 for this (which is what a commercial publisher told me it would retail for when they offered to distribute it) makes me feel more than a little uncomfortable. However, its the 21st century, so I can post the pdf on my website for free, and I can distribute hard copies via a print-on-demand service for less than half what a textbook publisher would charge. And so my guilt is assuaged, and Im willing to share! With that in mind, you can obtain free soft copies and cheap hard copies online, from the following webpages: http://www.compcogscisydney.com/learning-statistics-with-r.html http://www.lulu.com/content/13570633 Even so, the warning still stands: what you are looking at is Version 0.3 of a work in progress. If and when it hits Version 1.0, I would be willing to stand behind the work and say, yes, this is a textbook that I would encourage other people to use. At that point, Ill probably start shamelessly flogging the thing on the internet and generally acting like a tool. But until that day comes, Id like it to be made clear that Im really ambivalent about the work as it stands. All of the above being said, there is one group of people that I can enthusiastically endorse this book to: the psychology students taking our undergraduate research methods classes (DRIP and DRIP:A) in 2013. For you, this book is ideal, because it was written to accompany your stats lectures. If a problem arises due to a shortcoming of these notes, I can and will adapt content on the fly to fix that problem. Effectively, youve got a textbook written specifically for your classes, distributed for free (electronic copy) or at near-cost prices (hard copy). Better yet, the notes have been tested: Version 0.1 of these notes was used in the 2011 class, Version 0.2 was used in the 2012 class, and now youre looking at the new and improved Version 0.3. Im not saying these notes are titanium plated awesomeness on a stick  though if you wanted to say so on the student evaluation forms, then youre totally welcome to  because theyre not. But I am saying that theyve been tried out in previous years and they seem to work okay. Besides, theres a group of us around to troubleshoot if any problems come up, and you can guarantee that at least one of your lecturers has read the whole thing cover to cover! Okay, with all that out of the way, I should say something about what the book aims to be. At its core, it is an introductory statistics textbook pitched primarily at psychology students. As such, it covers the standard topics that youd expect of such a book: study design, descriptive statistics, the theory of hypothesis testing, \\(t\\)-tests, \\(\\chi^2\\) tests, ANOVA and regression. However, there are also several chapters devoted to the R statistical package, including a chapter on data manipulation and another one on scripts and programming. Moreover, when you look at the content presented in the book, youll notice a lot of topics that are traditionally swept under the carpet when teaching statistics to psychology students. The Bayesian/frequentist divide is openly disussed in the probability chapter, and the disagreement between Neyman and Fisher about hypothesis testing makes an appearance. The difference between probability and density is discussed. A detailed treatment of Type I, II and III sums of squares for unbalanced factorial ANOVA is provided. And if you have a look in the Epilogue, it should be clear that my intention is to add a lot more advanced content. My reasons for pursuing this approach are pretty simple: the students can handle it, and they even seem to enjoy it. Over the last few years Ive been pleasantly surprised at just how little difficulty Ive had in getting undergraduate psych students to learn R. Its certainly not easy for them, and Ive found I need to be a little charitable in setting marking standards, but they do eventually get there. Similarly, they dont seem to have a lot of problems tolerating ambiguity and complexity in presentation of statistical ideas, as long as they are assured that the assessment standards will be set in a fashion that is appropriate for them. So if the students can handle it, why not teach it? The potential gains are pretty enticing. If they learn R, the students get access to CRAN, which is perhaps the largest and most comprehensive library of statistical tools in existence. And if they learn about probability theory in detail, its easier for them to switch from orthodox null hypothesis testing to Bayesian methods if they want to. Better yet, they learn data analysis skills that they can take to an employer without being dependent on expensive and proprietary software. Sadly, this book isnt the silver bullet that makes all this possible. Its a work in progress, and maybe when it is finished it will be a useful tool. One among many, I would think. There are a number of other books that try to provide a basic introduction to statistics using R, and Im not arrogant enough to believe that mine is better. Still, I rather like the book, and maybe other people will find it useful, incomplete though it is. Dan Navarro January 13, 2013 "],["part-i.-background.html", "Part I. Background", " Part I.

Thou shalt not answer questionnaires Or quizzes upon World Affairs, Nor with compliance Take any test. Thou shalt not sit With statisticians nor commit  W.H. Auden1 1.1 On the psychology of statistics To the surprise of many students, statistics is a fairly significant part of a psychological education. To the surprise of no-one, statistics is very rarely the favourite part of ones psychological education. After all, if you really loved the idea of doing statistics, youd probably be enrolled in a statistics class right now, not a psychology class. So, not surprisingly, theres a pretty large proportion of the student base that isnt happy about the fact that psychology has so much statistics in it. In view of this, I thought that the right place to start might be to answer some of the more common questions that people have about stats. A big part of this issue at hand relates to the very idea of statistics. What is it? Whats it there for? And why are scientists so bloody obsessed with it? These are all good questions, when you think about it. So lets start with the last one. As a group, scientists seem to be bizarrely fixated on running statistical tests on everything. In fact, we use statistics so often that we sometimes forget to explain to people why we do. Its a kind of article of faith among scientists  and especially social scientists  that your findings cant be trusted until youve done some stats. Undergraduate students might be forgiven for thinking that were all completely mad, because no-one takes the time to answer one very simple question: Why do you do statistics? Why dont scientists just use common sense? Its a naive question in some ways, but most good questions are. Theres a lot of good answers to it,2 but for my money, the best answer is a really simple one: we dont trust ourselves enough. We worry that were human, and susceptible to all of the biases, temptations and frailties that humans suffer from. Much of statistics is basically a safeguard. Using common sense to evaluate evidence means trusting gut instincts, relying on verbal arguments and on using the raw power of human reason to come up with the right answer. Most scientists dont think this approach is likely to work. In fact, come to think of it, this sounds a lot like a psychological question to me, and since I do work in a psychology department, it seems like a good idea to dig a little deeper here. Is it really plausible to think that this common sense approach is very trustworthy? Verbal arguments have to be constructed in language, and all languages have biases  some things are harder to say than others, and not necessarily because theyre false (e.g., quantum electrodynamics is a good theory, but hard to explain in words). The instincts of our gut arent designed to solve scientific problems, theyre designed to handle day to day inferences  and given that biological evolution is slower than cultural change, we should say that theyre designed to solve the day to day problems for a different world than the one we live in. Most fundamentally, reasoning sensibly requires people to engage in induction, making wise guesses and going beyond the immediate evidence of the senses to make generalisations about the world. If you think that you can do that without being influenced by various distractors, well, I have a bridge in London Id like to sell you. Heck, as the next section shows, we cant even solve deductive problems (ones where no guessing is required) without being influenced by our pre-existing biases. 1.1.1 The curse of belief bias People are mostly pretty smart. Were certainly smarter than the other species that we share the planet with (though many people might disagree). Our minds are quite amazing things, and we seem to be capable of the most incredible feats of thought and reason. That doesnt make us perfect though. And among the many things that psychologists have shown over the years is that we really do find it hard to be neutral, to evaluate evidence impartially and without being swayed by pre-existing biases. A good example of this is the belief bias effect in logical reasoning: if you ask people to decide whether a particular argument is logically valid (i.e., conclusion would be true if the premises were true), we tend to be influenced by the believability of the conclusion, even when we shouldnt. For instance, heres a valid argument where the conclusion is believable: All cigarettes are expensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And heres a valid argument where the conclusion is not believable: All addictive things are expensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) The logical structure of argument #2 is identical to the structure of argument #1, and theyre both valid. However, in the second argument, there are good reasons to think that premise 1 is incorrect, and as a result its probably the case that the conclusion is also incorrect. But thats entirely irrelevant to the topic at hand; an argument is deductively valid if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises. That is, a valid argument doesnt have to involve true statements. On the other hand, heres an invalid argument that has a believable conclusion: All addictive things are expensive (Premise 1) Some cigarettes are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes (Conclusion) And finally, an invalid argument with an unbelievable conclusion: All cigarettes are expensive (Premise 1) Some addictive things are inexpensive (Premise 2) Therefore, some cigarettes are not addictive (Conclusion) Now, suppose that people really are perfectly able to set aside their pre-existing biases about what is true and what isnt, and purely evaluate an argument on its logical merits. Wed expect 100% of people to say that the valid arguments are valid, and 0% of people to say that the invalid arguments are valid. So if you ran an experiment looking at this, youd expect to see data like this: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 100% say valid 100% say valid argument is invalid 0% say valid 0% say valid If the psychological data looked like this (or even a good approximation to this), we might feel safe in just trusting our gut instincts. That is, itd be perfectly okay just to let scientists evaluate data based on their common sense, and not bother with all this murky statistics stuff. However, you guys have taken psych classes, and by now you probably know where this is going. In a classic study, J. St. B. T. Evans, Barston, and Pollard (1983) ran an experiment looking at exactly this. What they found is that when pre-existing biases (i.e., beliefs) were in agreement with the structure of the data, everything went the way youd hope: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say valid argument is invalid 8% say valid Not perfect, but thats pretty good. But look what happens when our intuitive feelings about the truth of the conclusion run against the logical structure of the argument: conclusion feels true conclusion feels false argument is valid 92% say valid 46% say valid argument is invalid 92% say valid 8% say valid Oh dear, thats not as good. Apparently, when people are presented with a strong argument that contradicts our pre-existing beliefs, we find it pretty hard to even perceive it to be a strong argument (people only did so 46% of the time). Even worse, when people are presented with a weak argument that agrees with our pre-existing biases, almost no-one can see that the argument is weak (people got that one wrong 92% of the time!).3 If you think about it, its not as if these data are horribly damning. Overall, people did do better than chance at compensating for their prior biases, since about 60% of peoples judgements were correct (youd expect 50% by chance). Even so, if you were a professional evaluator of evidence, and someone came along and offered you a magic tool that improves your chances of making the right decision from 60% to (say) 95%, youd probably jump at it, right? Of course you would. Thankfully, we actually do have a tool that can do this. But its not magic, its statistics. So thats reason #1 why scientists love statistics. Its just too easy for us to believe what we want to believe. So instead, if we want to believe in the data, were going to need a bit of help to keep our personal biases under control. Thats what statistics does, it helps keep us honest. 1.2 The cautionary tale of Simpsons paradox The following is a true story (I think!). In 1973, the University of California, Berkeley had some worries about the admissions of students into their postgraduate courses. Specifically, the thing that caused the problem was that the gender breakdown of their admissions, which looked like this Number of applicants Percent admitted Males 8442 46% Females 4321 35% Given this, they were worried about being sued!4 Given that there were nearly 13,000 applicants, a difference of 9% in admission rates between males and females is just way too big to be a coincidence. Pretty compelling data, right? And if I were to say to you that these data actually reflect a weak bias in favour of women (sort of!), youd probably think that I was either crazy or sexist. Oddly, its actually sort of true. When people started looking more carefully at the admissions data they told a rather different story (Bickel, Hammel, and OConnell 1975). Specifically, when they looked at it on a department by department basis, it turned out that most of the departments actually had a slightly higher success rate for female applicants than for male applicants. Table 1.1 shows the admission figures for the six largest departments (with the names of the departments removed for privacy reasons): Table 1.1: Admission figures for the six largest departments by gender Department Male Applicants Male Percent Admitted Female Applicants Female Percent admitted A 825 62% 108 82% B 560 63% 25 68% C 325 37% 593 34% D 417 33% 375 35% E 191 28% 393 24% F 272 6% 341 7% Remarkably, most departments had a higher rate of admissions for females than for males! Yet the overall rate of admission across the university for females was lower than for males. How can this be? How can both of these statements be true at the same time? Heres whats going on. Firstly, notice that the departments are not equal to one another in terms of their admission percentages: some departments (e.g., engineering, chemistry) tended to admit a high percentage of the qualified applicants, whereas others (e.g., English) tended to reject most of the candidates, even if they were high quality. So, among the six departments shown above, notice that department A is the most generous, followed by B, C, D, E and F in that order. Next, notice that males and females tended to apply to different departments. If we rank the departments in terms of the total number of male applicants, we get A&gt;B&gt;D&gt;C&gt;F&gt;E (the easy departments are in bold). On the whole, males tended to apply to the departments that had high admission rates. Now compare this to how the female applicants distributed themselves. Ranking the departments in terms of the total number of female applicants produces a quite different ordering C&gt;E&gt;D&gt;F&gt;A&gt;B. In other words, what these data seem to be suggesting is that the female applicants tended to apply to harder departments. And in fact, if we look at all Figure 1.1 we see that this trend is systematic, and quite striking. This effect is known as Simpsons paradox. Its not common, but it does happen in real life, and most people are very surprised by it when they first encounter it, and many people refuse to even believe that its real. It is very real. And while there are lots of very subtle statistical lessons buried in there, I want to use it to make a much more important point doing research is hard, and there are lots of subtle, counterintuitive traps lying in wait for the unwary. Thats reason #2 why scientists love statistics, and why we teach research methods. Because science is hard, and the truth is sometimes cunningly hidden in the nooks and crannies of complicated data. Figure 1.1: The Berkeley 1973 college admissions data. This figure plots the admission rate for the 85 departments that had at least one female applicant, as a function of the percentage of applicants that were female. The plot is a redrawing of Figure 1 from Bickel, Hammel, and OConnell (1975). Circles plot departments with more than 40 applicants; the area of the circle is proportional to the total number of applicants. The crosses plot department with fewer than 40 applicants. Before leaving this topic entirely, I want to point out something else really critical that is often overlooked in a research methods class. Statistics only solves part of the problem. Remember that we started all this with the concern that Berkeleys admissions processes might be unfairly biased against female applicants. When we looked at the aggregated data, it did seem like the university was discriminating against women, but when we disaggregate and looked at the individual behaviour of all the departments, it turned out that the actual departments were, if anything, slightly biased in favour of women. The gender bias in total admissions was caused by the fact that women tended to self-select for harder departments. From a legal perspective, that would probably put the university in the clear. Postgraduate admissions are determined at the level of the individual department, and there are good reasons to do that. At the level of individual departments the decisions are more or less unbiased (the weak bias in favour of females at that level is small, and not consistent across departments). Since the university cant dictate which departments people choose to apply to, and the decision making takes place at the level of the department it can hardly be held accountable for any biases that those choices produce. That was the basis for my somewhat glib remarks earlier, but thats not exactly the whole story, is it? After all, if were interested in this from a more sociological and psychological perspective, we might want to ask why there are such strong gender differences in applications. Why do males tend to apply to engineering more often than females, and why is this reversed for the English department? And why is it the case that the departments that tend to have a female-application bias tend to have lower overall admission rates than those departments that have a male-application bias? Might this not still reflect a gender bias, even though every single department is itself unbiased? It might. Suppose, hypothetically, that males preferred to apply to hard sciences and females prefer humanities. And suppose further that the reason for why the humanities departments have low admission rates is because the government doesnt want to fund the humanities (Ph.D. places, for instance, are often tied to government funded research projects). Does that constitute a gender bias? Or just an unenlightened view of the value of the humanities? What if someone at a high level in the government cut the humanities funds because they felt that the humanities are useless chick stuff. That seems pretty blatantly gender biased. None of this falls within the purview of statistics, but it matters to the research project. If youre interested in the overall structural effects of subtle gender biases, then you probably want to look at both the aggregated and disaggregated data. If youre interested in the decision making process at Berkeley itself then youre probably only interested in the disaggregated data. In short there are a lot of critical questions that you cant answer with statistics, but the answers to those questions will have a huge impact on how you analyse and interpret data. And this is the reason why you should always think of statistics as a tool to help you learn about your data. No more and no less. Its a powerful tool to that end, but theres no substitute for careful thought. 1.3 Statistics in psychology I hope that the discussion above helped explain why science in general is so focused on statistics. But Im guessing that you have a lot more questions about what role statistics plays in psychology, and specifically why psychology classes always devote so many lectures to stats. So heres my attempt to answer a few of them Why does psychology have so much statistics? To be perfectly honest, theres a few different reasons, some of which are better than others. The most important reason is that psychology is a statistical science. What I mean by that is that the things that we study are people. Real, complicated, gloriously messy, infuriatingly perverse people. The things of physics include objects like electrons, and while there are all sorts of complexities that arise in physics, electrons dont have minds of their own. They dont have opinions, they dont differ from each other in weird and arbitrary ways, they dont get bored in the middle of an experiment, and they dont get angry at the experimenter and then deliberately try to sabotage the data set (not that Ive ever done that!). At a fundamental level psychology is harder than physics.5 Basically, we teach statistics to you as psychologists because you need to be better at stats than physicists. Theres actually a saying used sometimes in physics, to the effect that if your experiment needs statistics, you should have done a better experiment. They have the luxury of being able to say that because their objects of study are pathetically simple in comparison to the vast mess that confronts social scientists. And its not just psychology. Most social sciences are desperately reliant on statistics. Not because were bad experimenters, but because weve picked a harder problem to solve. We teach you stats because you really, really need it. Cant someone else do the statistics? To some extent, but not completely. Its true that you dont need to become a fully trained statistician just to do psychology, but you do need to reach a certain level of statistical competence. In my view, theres three reasons that every psychological researcher ought to be able to do basic statistics: Firstly, theres the fundamental reason: statistics is deeply intertwined with research design. If you want to be good at designing psychological studies, you need to at the very least understand the basics of stats. Secondly, if you want to be good at the psychological side of the research, then you need to be able to understand the psychological literature, right? But almost every paper in the psychological literature reports the results of statistical analyses. So if you really want to understand the psychology, you need to be able to understand what other people did with their data. And that means understanding a certain amount of statistics. Thirdly, theres a big practical problem with being dependent on other people to do all your statistics: statistical analysis is expensive. If you ever get bored and want to look up how much the Australian government charges for university fees, youll notice something interesting: statistics is designated as a national priority category, and so the fees are much, much lower than for any other area of study. This is because theres a massive shortage of statisticians out there. So, from your perspective as a psychological researcher, the laws of supply and demand arent exactly on your side here! As a result, in almost any real life situation where you want to do psychological research, the cruel facts will be that you dont have enough money to afford a statistician. So the economics of the situation mean that you have to be pretty self-sufficient. Note that a lot of these reasons generalise beyond researchers. If you want to be a practicing psychologist and stay on top of the field, it helps to be able to read the scientific literature, which relies pretty heavily on statistics. I dont care about jobs, research, or clinical work. Do I need statistics? Okay, now youre just messing with me. Still, I think it should matter to you too. Statistics should matter to you in the same way that statistics should matter to everyone. We live in the 21st century, and data are everywhere. Frankly, given the world in which we live these days, a basic knowledge of statistics is pretty damn close to a survival tool! Which is the topic of the next section. 1.4 Statistics in everyday life We are drowning in information, but we are starved for knowledge -Various authors, original probably John Naisbitt When I started writing up my lecture notes I took the 20 most recent news articles posted to the ABC news website. Of those 20 articles, it turned out that 8 of them involved a discussion of something that I would call a statistical topic and 6 of those made a mistake. The most common error, if youre curious, was failing to report baseline data (e.g., the article mentions that 5% of people in situation X have some characteristic Y, but doesnt say how common the characteristic is for everyone else!). The point Im trying to make here isnt that journalists are bad at statistics (though they almost always are), its that a basic knowledge of statistics is very helpful for trying to figure out when someone else is either making a mistake or even lying to you. In fact, one of the biggest things that a knowledge of statistics does to you is cause you to get angry at the newspaper or the internet on a far more frequent basis. You can find a good example of this in 4.1.5. In later versions of this book Ill try to include more anecdotes along those lines. 1.5 Theres more to research methods than statistics So far, most of what Ive talked about is statistics, and so youd be forgiven for thinking that statistics is all I care about in life. To be fair, you wouldnt be far wrong, but research methodology is a broader concept than statistics. So most research methods courses will cover a lot of topics that relate much more to the pragmatics of research design, and in particular the issues that you encounter when trying to do research with humans. However, about 99% of student fears relate to the statistics part of the course, so Ive focused on the stats in this discussion, and hopefully Ive convinced you that statistics matters, and more importantly, that its not to be feared. That being said, its pretty typical for introductory research methods classes to be very stats-heavy. This is not (usually) because the lecturers are evil people. Quite the contrary, in fact. Introductory classes focus a lot on the statistics because you almost always find yourself needing statistics before you need the other research methods training. Why? Because almost all of your assignments in other classes will rely on statistical training, to a much greater extent than they rely on other methodological tools. Its not common for undergraduate assignments to require you to design your own study from the ground up (in which case you would need to know a lot about research design), but it is common for assignments to ask you to analyse and interpret data that were collected in a study that someone else designed (in which case you need statistics). In that sense, from the perspective of allowing you to do well in all your other classes, the statistics is more urgent. But note that urgent is different from important  they both matter. I really do want to stress that research design is just as important as data analysis, and this book does spend a fair amount of time on it. However, while statistics has a kind of universality, and provides a set of core tools that are useful for most types of psychological research, the research methods side isnt quite so universal. There are some general principles that everyone should think about, but a lot of research design is very idiosyncratic, and is specific to the area of research that you want to engage in. To the extent that its the details that matter, those details dont usually show up in an introductory stats and research methods class.

However, since the focus of this book is much more on data analysis than on data collection, Im only giving a very brief overview. Note that this chapter is special in two ways. Firstly, its much more psychology-specific than the later chapters. Secondly, it focuses much more heavily on the scientific problem of research methodology, and much less on the statistical problem of data analysis. Nevertheless, the two problems are related to one another, so its traditional for stats textbooks to discuss the problem in a little detail. This chapter relies heavily on Campbell and Stanley (1963) for the discussion of study design, and Stevens (1946) for the discussion of scales of measurement. 2.1 Introduction to psychological measurement The first thing to understand is data collection can be thought of as a kind of measurement. That is, what were trying to do here is measure something about human behaviour or the human mind. What do I mean by measurement? 2.1.1 Some thoughts about psychological measurement Measurement itself is a subtle concept, but basically it comes down to finding some way of assigning numbers, or labels, or some other kind of well-defined descriptions, to stuff. So, any of the following would count as a psychological measurement: My age is 33 years. I do not like anchovies. My chromosomal gender is male. My self-identified gender is male.7 In the short list above, the bolded part is the thing to be measured, and the italicised part is the measurement itself. In fact, we can expand on this a little bit, by thinking about the set of possible measurements that could have arisen in each case: My age (in years) could have been 0, 1, 2, 3 , etc. The upper bound on what my age could possibly be is a bit fuzzy, but in practice youd be safe in saying that the largest possible age is 150, since no human has ever lived that long. When asked if I like anchovies, I might have said that I do, or I do not, or I have no opinion, or I sometimes do. My chromosomal gender is almost certainly going to be male (XY) or female (XX), but there are a few other possibilities. I could also have Klinfelters syndrome (XXY), which is more similar to male than to female. And I imagine there are other possibilities too. My self-identified gender is also very likely to be male or female, but it doesnt have to agree with my chromosomal gender. I may also choose to identify with neither, or to explicitly call myself transgender. As you can see, for some things (like age) it seems fairly obvious what the set of possible measurements should be, whereas for other things it gets a bit tricky. But I want to point out that even in the case of someones age its much more subtle than this. For instance, in the example above I assumed that it was okay to measure age in years. But if youre a developmental psychologist, thats way too crude, and so you often measure age in years and months (if a child is 2 years and 11 months this is usually written as 2;11). If youre interested in newborns you might want to measure age in days since birth, maybe even hours since birth. In other words, the way in which you specify the allowable measurement values is important. Looking at this a bit more closely, you might also realise that the concept of age isnt actually all that precise. In general, when we say age we implicitly mean the length of time since birth. But thats not always the right way to do it. Suppose youre interested in how newborn babies control their eye movements. If youre interested in kids that young, you might also start to worry that birth is not the only meaningful point in time to care about. If Baby Alice is born 3 weeks premature and Baby Bianca is born 1 week late, would it really make sense to say that they are the same age if we encountered them 2 hours after birth? In one sense, yes. By social convention we use birth as our reference point for talking about age in everyday life, since it defines the amount of time the person has been operating as an independent entity in the world. But from a scientific perspective thats not the only thing we care about. When we think about the biology of human beings, its often useful to think of ourselves as organisms that have been growing and maturing since conception, and from that perspective Alice and Bianca arent the same age at all. So you might want to define the concept of age in two different ways: the length of time since conception and the length of time since birth. When dealing with adults it wont make much difference, but when dealing with newborns it might. Moving beyond these issues, theres the question of methodology. What specific measurement method are you going to use to find out someones age? As before, there are lots of different possibilities: You could just ask people how old are you? The method of self-report is fast, cheap and easy. But it only works with people old enough to understand the question, and some people lie about their age. You could ask an authority (e.g., a parent) how old is your child? This method is fast, and when dealing with kids its not all that hard since the parent is almost always around. It doesnt work as well if you want to know age since conception, since a lot of parents cant say for sure when conception took place. For that, you might need a different authority (e.g., an obstetrician). You could look up official records, for example birth or death certificates. This is a time consuming and frustrating endeavour, but it has its uses (e.g., if the person is now dead). 2.1.2 Operationalisation: defining your measurement All of the ideas discussed in the previous section relate to the concept of operationalisation. To be a bit more precise about the idea, operationalisation is the process by which we take a meaningful but somewhat vague concept and turn it into a precise measurement. The process of operationalisation can involve several different things: Being precise about what you are trying to measure. For instance, does age mean time since birth or time since conception in the context of your research? Determining what method you will use to measure it. Will you use self-report to measure age, ask a parent, or look up an official record? If youre using self-report, how will you phrase the question? Defining the set of allowable values that the measurement can take. Note that these values dont always have to be numerical, though they often are. When measuring age the values are numerical, but we still need to think carefully about what numbers are allowed. Do we want age in years, years and months, days, or hours? For other types of measurements (e.g., gender) the values arent numerical. But, just as before, we need to think about what values are allowed. If were asking people to self-report their gender, what options to we allow them to choose between? Is it enough to allow only male or female? Do you need an other option? Or should we not give people specific options and instead let them answer in their own words? And if you open up the set of possible values to include all verbal response, how will you interpret their answers? Operationalisation is a tricky business, and theres no one, true way to do it. The way in which you choose to operationalise the informal concept of age or gender into a formal measurement depends on what you need to use the measurement for. Often youll find that the community of scientists who work in your area have some fairly well-established ideas for how to go about it. In other words, operationalisation needs to be thought through on a case by case basis. Nevertheless, while there a lot of issues that are specific to each individual research project, there are some aspects to it that are pretty general. Before moving on I want to take a moment to clear up our terminology, and in the process introduce one more term. Here are four different things that are closely related to each other: A theoretical construct. This is the thing that youre trying to take a measurement of, like age, gender or an opinion. A theoretical construct cant be directly observed, and often theyre actually a bit vague. A measure. The measure refers to the method or the tool that you use to make your observations. A question in a survey, a behavioural observation or a brain scan could all count as a measure. An operationalisation. The term operationalisation refers to the logical connection between the measure and the theoretical construct, or to the process by which we try to derive a measure from a theoretical construct. A variable. Finally, a new term. A variable is what we end up with when we apply our measure to something in the world. That is, variables are the actual data that we end up with in our data sets. In practice, even scientists tend to blur the distinction between these things, but its very helpful to try to understand the differences. 2.2 Scales of measurement As the previous section indicates, the outcome of a psychological measurement is called a variable. But not all variables are of the same qualitative type and so its useful to understand what types there are. A very useful concept for distinguishing between different types of variables is whats known as scales of measurement. 2.2.1 Nominal scale A nominal scale variable (also referred to as a categorical variable) is one in which there is no particular relationship between the different possibilities. For these kinds of variables it doesnt make any sense to say that one of them is bigger orbetter\" than any other one, and it absolutely doesnt make any sense to average them. The classic example for this is eye colour. Eyes can be blue, green or brown, amongst other possibilities, but none of them is any bigger than any other one. As a result, it would feel really weird to talk about an average eye colour. Similarly, gender is nominal too: male isnt better or worse than female. Neither does it make sense to try to talk about an average gender. In short, nominal scale variables are those for which the only thing you can say about the different possibilities is that they are different. Thats it. Lets take a slightly closer look at this. Suppose I was doing research on how people commute to and from work. One variable I would have to measure would be what kind of transportation people use to get to work. This transport type variable could have quite a few possible values, including: train, bus, car, bicycle. For now, lets suppose that these four are the only possibilities. Then imagine that I ask 100 people how they got to work today, with this result: Transportation Number of people (1) Train 12 (2) Bus 30 (3) Car 48 (4) Bicycle 10 So, whats the average transportation type? Obviously, the answer here is that there isnt one. Its a silly question to ask. You can say that travel by car is the most popular method, and travel by train is the least popular method, but thats about all. Similarly, notice that the order in which I list the options isnt very interesting. I could have chosen to display the data like this Transportation Number of people (3) Car 48 (1) Train 12 (4) Bicycle 10 (2) Bus 30 and nothing really changes. 2.2.2 Ordinal scale Ordinal scale variables have a bit more structure than nominal scale variables, but not by a lot. An ordinal scale variable is one in which there is a natural, meaningful way to order the different possibilities, but you cant do anything else. The usual example given of an ordinal variable is finishing position in a race. You can say that the person who finished first was faster than the person who finished second, but you dont know how much faster. As a consequence we know that 1st \\(&gt;\\) 2nd, and we know that 2nd \\(&gt;\\) 3rd, but the difference between 1st and 2nd might be much larger than the difference between 2nd and 3rd. Heres a more psychologically interesting example. Suppose Im interested in peoples attitudes to climate change. I then go and ask some people to pick the statement (from four listed statements) that most closely matches their beliefs: Temperatures are rising because of human activity Temperatures are rising but we dont know why Temperatures are rising but not because of humans Temperatures are not rising Notice that these four statements actually do have a natural ordering, in terms of the extent to which they agree with the current science. Statement 1 is a close match, statement 2 is a reasonable match, statement 3 isnt a very good match, and statement 4 is in strong opposition to current science. So, in terms of the thing Im interested in (the extent to which people endorse the science), I can order the items as \\(1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4\\). Since this ordering exists, it would be very weird to list the options like this Temperatures are rising but not because of humans Temperatures are rising because of human activity Temperatures are not rising Temperatures are rising but we dont know why because it seems to violate the natural structure to the question. So, lets suppose I asked 100 people these questions, and got the following answers Response Number (1) Temperatures are rising, because of human activity 51 (2) Temperatures are rising, but we dont know why 20 (3) Temperatures are rising, but not because of humans 10 (4) Temperatures are not rising 19 When analysing these data it seems quite reasonable to try to group (1), (2) and (3) together, and say that 81 out of 100 people were willing to at least partially endorse the science. And its also quite reasonable to group (2), (3) and (4) together and say that 49 out of 100 people registered at least some disagreement with the dominant scientific view. However, it would be entirely bizarre to try to group (1), (2) and (4) together and say that 90 out of 100 people said  what? Theres nothing sensible that allows you to group those responses together at all. That said, notice that while we can use the natural ordering of these items to construct sensible groupings, what we cant do is average them. For instance, in my simple example here, the average response to the question is 1.97. If you can tell me what that means Id love to know, because it seems like gibberish to me! 2.2.3 Interval scale In contrast to nominal and ordinal scale variables, interval scale and ratio scale variables are variables for which the numerical value is genuinely meaningful. In the case of interval scale variables the differences between the numbers are interpretable, but the variable doesnt have a natural zero value. A good example of an interval scale variable is measuring temperature in degrees celsius. For instance, if it was 15\\(^\\circ\\) yesterday and 18\\(^\\circ\\) today, then the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between the two is genuinely meaningful. Moreover, that 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference is exactly the same as the 3\\(^\\circ\\) difference between \\(7^\\circ\\) and \\(10^\\circ\\). In short, addition and subtraction are meaningful for interval scale variables.8 However, notice that the \\(0^\\circ\\) does not mean no temperature at all. It actually means the temperature at which water freezes, which is pretty arbitrary. As a consequence it becomes pointless to try to multiply and divide temperatures. It is wrong to say that \\(20^\\circ\\) is twice as hot as \\(10^\\circ\\), just as it is weird and meaningless to try to claim that \\(20^\\circ\\) is negative two times as hot as \\(-10^\\circ\\). Again, lets look at a more psychological example. Suppose Im interested in looking at how the attitudes of first-year university students have changed over time. Obviously, Im going to want to record the year in which each student started. This is an interval scale variable. A student who started in 2003 did arrive 5 years before a student who started in 2008. However, it would be completely daft for me to divide 2008 by 2003 and say that the second student started 1.0024 times later than the first one. That doesnt make any sense at all. 2.2.4 Ratio scale The fourth and final type of variable to consider is a ratio scale variable, in which zero really means zero, and its okay to multiply and divide. A good psychological example of a ratio scale variable is response time (RT). In a lot of tasks its very common to record the amount of time somebody takes to solve a problem or answer a question, because its an indicator of how difficult the task is. Suppose that Alan takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, whereas Ben takes 3.1 seconds. As with an interval scale variable, addition and subtraction are both meaningful here. Ben really did take \\(3.1 - 2.3 = 0.8\\) seconds longer than Alan did. However, notice that multiplication and division also make sense here too: Ben took \\(3.1 / 2.3 = 1.35\\) times as long as Alan did to answer the question. And the reason why you can do this is that for a ratio scale variable such as RT zero seconds really does mean no time at all. 2.2.5 Continuous versus discrete variables Theres a second kind of distinction that you need to be aware of, regarding what types of variables you can run into. This is the distinction between continuous variables and discrete variables. The difference between these is as follows: A continuous variable is one in which, for any two values that you can think of, its always logically possible to have another value in between. A discrete variable is, in effect, a variable that isnt continuous. For a discrete variable its sometimes the case that theres nothing in the middle. These definitions probably seem a bit abstract, but theyre pretty simple once you see some examples. For instance, response time is continuous. If Alan takes 3.1 seconds and Ben takes 2.3 seconds to respond to a question, then Camerons response time will lie in between if he took 3.0 seconds. And of course it would also be possible for David to take 3.031 seconds to respond, meaning that his RT would lie in between Camerons and Alans. And while in practice it might be impossible to measure RT that precisely, its certainly possible in principle. Because we can always find a new value for RT in between any two other ones we regard RT as a continuous measure. Discrete variables occur when this rule is violated. For example, nominal scale variables are always discrete. There isnt a type of transportation that falls in between trains and bicycles, not in the strict mathematical way that 2.3 falls in between 2 and 3. So transportation type is discrete. Similarly, ordinal scale variables are always discrete. Although 2nd place does fall between 1st place and 3rd place, theres nothing that can logically fall in between 1st place and 2nd place. Interval scale and ratio scale variables can go either way. As we saw above, response time (a ratio scale variable) is continuous. Temperature in degrees celsius (an interval scale variable) is also continuous. However, the year you went to school (an interval scale variable) is discrete. Theres no year in between 2002 and 2003. The number of questions you get right on a true-or-false test (a ratio scale variable) is also discrete. Since a true-or-false question doesnt allow you to be partially correct, theres nothing in between 5/10 and 6/10. Table 2.1 summarises the relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. Im trying to hammer this point home, because (a) some textbooks get this wrong, and (b) people very often say things like discrete variable when they mean nominal scale variable. Its very unfortunate. Table 2.1: The relationship between the scales of measurement and the discrete/continuity distinction. Cells with a tick mark correspond to things that are possible. continuous discrete nominal \\(\\checkmark\\) ordinal \\(\\checkmark\\) interval \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) ratio \\(\\checkmark\\) \\(\\checkmark\\) 2.2.6 Some complexities Okay, I know youre going to be shocked to hear this, but the real world is much messier than this little classification scheme suggests. Very few variables in real life actually fall into these nice neat categories, so you need to be kind of careful not to treat the scales of measurement as if they were hard and fast rules. It doesnt work like that. Theyre guidelines, intended to help you think about the situations in which you should treat different variables differently. Nothing more. So lets take a classic example, maybe the classic example, of a psychological measurement tool: the Likert scale. The humble Likert scale is the bread and butter tool of all survey design. You yourself have filled out hundreds, maybe thousands, of them and odds are youve even used one yourself. Suppose we have a survey question that looks like this: Which of the following best describes your opinion of the statement that all pirates are freaking awesome? and then the options presented to the participant are these: Strongly disagree Disagree Neither agree nor disagree Agree Strongly agree This set of items is an example of a 5-point Likert scale, in which people are asked to choose among one of several (in this case 5) clearly ordered possibilities, generally with a verbal descriptor given in each case. However, its not necessary that all items are explicitly described. This is a perfectly good example of a 5-point Likert scale too: Strongly disagree Strongly agree Likert scales are very handy, if somewhat limited, tools. The question is what kind of variable are they? Theyre obviously discrete, since you cant give a response of 2.5. Theyre obviously not nominal scale, since the items are ordered; and theyre not ratio scale either, since theres no natural zero. But are they ordinal scale or interval scale? One argument says that we cant really prove that the difference between strongly agree and agree is of the same size as the difference between agree and neither agree nor disagree. In fact, in everyday life its pretty obvious that theyre not the same at all. So this suggests that we ought to treat Likert scales as ordinal variables. On the other hand, in practice most participants do seem to take the whole on a scale from 1 to 5 part fairly seriously, and they tend to act as if the differences between the five response options were fairly similar to one another. As a consequence, a lot of researchers treat Likert scale data as interval scale.9 Its not interval scale, but in practice its close enough that we usually think of it as being quasi-interval scale. 2.3 Assessing the reliability of a measurement At this point weve thought a little bit about how to operationalise a theoretical construct and thereby create a psychological measure. And weve seen that by applying psychological measures we end up with variables, which can come in many different types. At this point, we should start discussing the obvious question: is the measurement any good? Well do this in terms of two related ideas: reliability and validity. Put simply, the reliability of a measure tells you how precisely you are measuring something, whereas the validity of a measure tells you how accurate the measure is. In this section Ill talk about reliability; well talk about validity in section 2.6. Reliability is actually a very simple concept. It refers to the repeatability or consistency of your measurement. The measurement of my weight by means of a bathroom scale is very reliable. If I step on and off the scales over and over again, itll keep giving me the same answer. Measuring my intelligence by means of asking my mum is very unreliable. Some days she tells me Im a bit thick, and other days she tells me Im a complete idiot. Notice that this concept of reliability is different to the question of whether the measurements are correct (the correctness of a measurement relates to its validity). If Im holding a sack of potatos when I step on and off the bathroom scales the measurement will still be reliable: it will always give me the same answer. However, this highly reliable answer doesnt match up to my true weight at all, therefore its wrong. In technical terms, this is a reliable but invalid measurement. Similarly, whilst my mums estimate of my intelligence is a bit unreliable, she might be right. Maybe Im just not too bright, and so while her estimate of my intelligence fluctuates pretty wildly from day to day, its basically right. That would be an unreliable but valid measure. Of course, if my mums estimates are too unreliable its going to be very hard to figure out which one of her many claims about my intelligence is actually the right one. To some extent, then, a very unreliable measure tends to end up being invalid for practical purposes; so much so that many people would say that reliability is necessary (but not sufficient) to ensure validity. Okay, now that were clear on the distinction between reliability and validity, lets have a think about the different ways in which we might measure reliability: Test-retest reliability. This relates to consistency over time. If we repeat the measurement at a later date do we get a the same answer? Inter-rater reliability. This relates to consistency across people. If someone else repeats the measurement (e.g., someone else rates my intelligence) will they produce the same answer? Parallel forms reliability. This relates to consistency across theoretically-equivalent measurements. If I use a different set of bathroom scales to measure my weight does it give the same answer? Internal consistency reliability. If a measurement is constructed from lots of different parts that perform similar functions (e.g., a personality questionnaire result is added up across several questions) do the individual parts tend to give similar answers. Well look at this particular form of reliability later in the book, in Section ??. Not all measurements need to possess all forms of reliability. For instance, educational assessment can be thought of as a form of measurement. One of the subjects that I teach, Computational Cognitive Science, has an assessment structure that has a research component and an exam component (plus other things). The exam component is intended to measure something different from the research component, so the assessment as a whole has low internal consistency. However, within the exam there are several questions that are intended to (approximately) measure the same things, and those tend to produce similar outcomes. So the exam on its own has a fairly high internal consistency. Which is as it should be. You should only demand reliability in those situations where you want to be measuring the same thing! 2.4 The role of variables: predictors and outcomes Ive got one last piece of terminology that I need to explain to you before moving away from variables. Normally, when we do some research we end up with lots of different variables. Then, when we analyse our data, we usually try to explain some of the variables in terms of some of the other variables. Its important to keep the two roles thing doing the explaining and thing being explained distinct. So lets be clear about this now. First, we might as well get used to the idea of using mathematical symbols to describe variables, since its going to happen over and over again. Lets denote the to be explained variable \\(Y\\), and denote the variables doing the explaining as \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), etc. When we are doing an analysis we have different names for \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), since they play different roles in the analysis. The classical names for these roles are independent variable (IV) and dependent variable (DV). The IV is the variable that you use to do the explaining (i.e., \\(X\\)) and the DV is the variable being explained (i.e., \\(Y\\)). The logic behind these names goes like this: if there really is a relationship between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) then we can say that \\(Y\\) depends on \\(X\\), and if we have designed our study properly then \\(X\\) isnt dependent on anything else. However, I personally find those names horrible. Theyre hard to remember and theyre highly misleading because (a) the IV is never actually independent of everything else, and (b) if theres no relationship then the DV doesnt actually depend on the IV. And in fact, because Im not the only person who thinks that IV and DV are just awful names, there are a number of alternatives that I find more appealing. The terms that Ill use in this book are predictors and outcomes. The idea here is that what youre trying to do is use \\(X\\) (the predictors) to make guesses about \\(Y\\) (the outcomes).10 This is summarised in Table 2.2. Table 2.2: The terminology used to distinguish between different roles that a variable can play when analysing a data set. Note that this book will tend to avoid the classical terminology in favour of the newer names. role of the variable classical name modern name to be explained dependent variable (DV) outcome to do the explaining independent variable (IV) predictor 2.5 Experimental and non-experimental research One of the big distinctions that you should be aware of is the distinction between experimental research and non-experimental research. When we make this distinction, what were really talking about is the degree of control that the researcher exercises over the people and events in the study. 2.5.1 Experimental research The key feature of experimental research is that the researcher controls all aspects of the study, especially what participants experience during the study. In particular, the researcher manipulates or varies the predictor variables (IVs) but allows the outcome variable (DV) to vary naturally. The idea here is to deliberately vary the predictors (IVs) to see if they have any causal effects on the outcomes. Moreover, in order to ensure that theres no possibility that something other than the predictor variables is causing the outcomes, everything else is kept constant or is in some other way balanced, to ensure that they have no effect on the results. In practice, its almost impossible to think of everything else that might have an influence on the outcome of an experiment, much less keep it constant. The standard solution to this is randomisation. That is, we randomly assign people to different groups, and then give each group a different treatment (i.e., assign them different values of the predictor variables). Well talk more about randomisation later, but for now its enough to say that what randomisation does is minimise (but not eliminate) the possibility that there are any systematic difference between groups. Lets consider a very simple, completely unrealistic and grossly unethical example. Suppose you wanted to find out if smoking causes lung cancer. One way to do this would be to find people who smoke and people who dont smoke and look to see if smokers have a higher rate of lung cancer. This is not a proper experiment, since the researcher doesnt have a lot of control over who is and isnt a smoker. And this really matters. For instance, it might be that people who choose to smoke cigarettes also tend to have poor diets, or maybe they tend to work in asbestos mines, or whatever. The point here is that the groups (smokers and non-smokers) actually differ on lots of things, not just smoking. So it might be that the higher incidence of lung cancer among smokers is caused by something else, and not by smoking per se. In technical terms these other things (e.g. diet) are called confounders, and well talk about those in just a moment. In the meantime, lets consider what a proper experiment might look like. Recall that our concern was that smokers and non-smokers might differ in lots of ways. The solution, as long as you have no ethics, is to control who smokes and who doesnt. Specifically, if we randomly divide young non-smokers into two groups and force half of them to become smokers, then its very unlikely that the groups will differ in any respect other than the fact that half of them smoke. That way, if our smoking group gets cancer at a higher rate than the non-smoking group, we can feel pretty confident that (a) smoking does cause cancer and (b) were murderers. 2.5.2 Non-experimental research Non-experimental research is a broad term that covers any study in which the researcher doesnt have as much control as they do in an experiment. Obviously, control is something that scientists like to have, but as the previous example illustrates there are lots of situations in which you cant or shouldnt try to obtain that control. Since its grossly unethical (and almost certainly criminal) to force people to smoke in order to find out if they get cancer, this is a good example of a situation in which you really shouldnt try to obtain experimental control. But there are other reasons too. Even leaving aside the ethical issues, our smoking experiment does have a few other issues. For instance, when I suggested that we force half of the people to become smokers, I was talking about starting with a sample of non-smokers, and then forcing them to become smokers. While this sounds like the kind of solid, evil experimental design that a mad scientist would love, it might not be a very sound way of investigating the effect in the real world. For instance, suppose that smoking only causes lung cancer when people have poor diets, and suppose also that people who normally smoke do tend to have poor diets. However, since the smokers in our experiment arent natural smokers (i.e., we forced non-smokers to become smokers, but they didnt take on all of the other normal, real life characteristics that smokers might tend to possess) they probably have better diets. As such, in this silly example they wouldnt get lung cancer and our experiment will fail, because it violates the structure of the natural world (the technical name for this is an artefactual result). One distinction worth making between two types of non-experimental research is the difference between quasi-experimental research and case studies. The example I discussed earlier, in which we wanted to examine incidence of lung cancer among smokers and non-smokers without trying to control who smokes and who doesnt, is a quasi-experimental design. That is, its the same as an experiment but we dont control the predictors (IVs). We can still use statistics to analyse the results, but we have to be a lot more careful and circumspect. The alternative approach, case studies, aims to provide a very detailed description of one or a few instances. In general, you cant use statistics to analyse the results of case studies and its usually very hard to draw any general conclusions about people in general from a few isolated examples. However, case studies are very useful in some situations. Firstly, there are situations where you dont have any alternative. Neuropsychology has this issue a lot. Sometimes, you just cant find a lot of people with brain damage in a specific brain area, so the only thing you can do is describe those cases that you do have in as much detail and with as much care as you can. However, theres also some genuine advantages to case studies. Because you dont have as many people to study you have the ability to invest lots of time and effort trying to understand the specific factors at play in each case. This is a very valuable thing to do. As a consequence, case studies can complement the more statistically-oriented approaches that you see in experimental and quasi-experimental designs. We wont talk much about case studies in this book, but they are nevertheless very valuable tools! 2.6 Assessing the validity of a study More than any other thing, a scientist wants their research to be valid. The conceptual idea behind validity is very simple. Can you trust the results of your study? If not, the study is invalid. However, whilst its easy to state, in practice its much harder to check validity than it is to check reliability. And in all honesty, theres no precise, clearly agreed upon notion of what validity actually is. In fact, there are lots of different kinds of validity, each of which raises its own issues. And not all forms of validity are relevant to all studies. Im going to talk about five different types of validity: Internal validity External validity Construct validity Face validity Ecological validity First, a quick guide as to what matters here. (1) Internal and external validity are the most important, since they tie directly to the fundamental question of whether your study really works. (2) Construct validity asks whether youre measuring what you think you are. (3) Face validity isnt terribly important except insofar as you care about appearances. (4) Ecological validity is a special case of face validity that corresponds to a kind of appearance that you might care about a lot. 2.6.1 Internal validity Internal validity refers to the extent to which you are able draw the correct conclusions about the causal relationships between variables. Its called internal because it refers to the relationships between things inside the study. Lets illustrate the concept with a simple example. Suppose youre interested in finding out whether a university education makes you write better. To do so, you get a group of first year students, ask them to write a 1000 word essay, and count the number of spelling and grammatical errors they make. Then you find some third-year students, who obviously have had more of a university education than the first-years, and repeat the exercise. And lets suppose it turns out that the third-year students produce fewer errors. And so you conclude that a university education improves writing skills. Right? Except that the big problem with this experiment is that the third-year students are older and theyve had more experience with writing things. So its hard to know for sure what the causal relationship is. Do older people write better? Or people who have had more writing experience? Or people who have had more education? Which of the above is the true cause of the superior performance of the third-years? Age? Experience? Education? You cant tell. This is an example of a failure of internal validity, because your study doesnt properly tease apart the causal relationships between the different variables. 2.6.2 External validity External validity relates to the generalisability or applicability of your findings. That is, to what extent do you expect to see the same pattern of results in real life as you saw in your study. To put it a bit more precisely, any study that you do in psychology will involve a fairly specific set of questions or tasks, will occur in a specific environment, and will involve participants that are drawn from a particular subgroup (disappointingly often it is college students!). So, if it turns out that the results dont actually generalise or apply to people and situations beyond the ones that you studied, then what youve got is a lack of external validity. The classic example of this issue is the fact that a very large proportion of studies in psychology will use undergraduate psychology students as the participants. Obviously, however, the researchers dont care only about psychology students. They care about people in general. Given that, a study that uses only psychology students as participants always carries a risk of lacking external validity. That is, if theres something special about psychology students that makes them different to the general population in some relevant respect, then we may start worrying about a lack of external validity. That said, it is absolutely critical to realise that a study that uses only psychology students does not necessarily have a problem with external validity. Ill talk about this again later, but its such a common mistake that Im going to mention it here. The external validity of a study is threatened by the choice of population if (a) the population from which you sample your participants is very narrow (e.g., psychology students), and (b) the narrow population that you sampled from is systematically different from the general population in some respect that is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that you intend to study. The italicised part is the bit that lots of people forget. It is true that psychology undergraduates differ from the general population in lots of ways, and so a study that uses only psychology students may have problems with external validity. However, if those differences arent very relevant to the phenomenon that youre studying, then theres nothing to worry about. To make this a bit more concrete here are two extreme examples: You want to measure attitudes of the general public towards psychotherapy, but all of your participants are psychology students. This study would almost certainly have a problem with external validity. You want to measure the effectiveness of a visual illusion, and your participants are all psychology students. This study is unlikely to have a problem with external validity Having just spent the last couple of paragraphs focusing on the choice of participants, since thats a big issue that everyone tends to worry most about, its worth remembering that external validity is a broader concept. The following are also examples of things that might pose a threat to external validity, depending on what kind of study youre doing: People might answer a psychology questionnaire in a manner that doesnt reflect what they would do in real life. Your lab experiment on (say) human learning has a different structure to the learning problems people face in real life. 2.6.3 Construct validity Construct validity is basically a question of whether youre measuring what you want to be measuring. A measurement has good construct validity if it is actually measuring the correct theoretical construct, and bad construct validity if it doesnt. To give a very simple (if ridiculous) example, suppose Im trying to investigate the rates with which university students cheat on their exams. And the way I attempt to measure it is by asking the cheating students to stand up in the lecture theatre so that I can count them. When I do this with a class of 300 students 0 people claim to be cheaters. So I therefore conclude that the proportion of cheaters in my class is 0%. Clearly this is a bit ridiculous. But the point here is not that this is a very deep methodological example, but rather to explain what construct validity is. The problem with my measure is that while Im trying to measure the proportion of people who cheat what Im actually measuring is the proportion of people stupid enough to own up to cheating, or bloody minded enough to pretend that they do. Obviously, these arent the same thing! So my study has gone wrong, because my measurement has very poor construct validity. 2.6.4 Face validity Face validity simply refers to whether or not a measure looks like its doing what its supposed to, nothing more. If I design a test of intelligence, and people look at it and they say no, that test doesnt measure intelligence, then the measure lacks face validity. Its as simple as that. Obviously, face validity isnt very important from a pure scientific perspective. After all, what we care about is whether or not the measure actually does what its supposed to do, not whether it looks like it does what its supposed to do. As a consequence, we generally dont care very much about face validity. That said, the concept of face validity serves three useful pragmatic purposes: Sometimes, an experienced scientist will have a hunch that a particular measure wont work. While these sorts of hunches have no strict evidentiary value, its often worth paying attention to them. Because often times people have knowledge that they cant quite verbalise, so there might be something to worry about even if you cant quite say why. In other words, when someone you trust criticises the face validity of your study, its worth taking the time to think more carefully about your design to see if you can think of reasons why it might go awry. Mind you, if you dont find any reason for concern, then you should probably not worry. After all, face validity really doesnt matter very much. Often (very often), completely uninformed people will also have a hunch that your research is crap. And theyll criticise it on the internet or something. On close inspection you may notice that these criticisms are actually focused entirely on how the study looks, but not on anything deeper. The concept of face validity is useful for gently explaining to people that they need to substantiate their arguments further. Expanding on the last point, if the beliefs of untrained people are critical (e.g., this is often the case for applied research where you actually want to convince policy makers of something or other) then you have to care about face validity. Simply because, whether you like it or not, a lot of people will use face validity as a proxy for real validity. If you want the government to change a law on scientific psychological grounds, then it wont matter how good your studies really are. If they lack face validity youll find that politicians ignore you. Of course, its somewhat unfair that policy often depends more on appearance than fact, but thats how things go. 2.6.5 Ecological validity Ecological validity is a different notion of validity, which is similar to external validity, but less important. The idea is that, in order to be ecologically valid, the entire set up of the study should closely approximate the real world scenario that is being investigated. In a sense, ecological validity is a kind of face validity. It relates mostly to whether the study looks right, but with a bit more rigour to it. To be ecologically valid the study has to look right in a fairly specific way. The idea behind it is the intuition that a study that is ecologically valid is more likely to be externally valid. Its no guarantee, of course. But the nice thing about ecological validity is that its much easier to check whether a study is ecologically valid than it is to check whether a study is externally valid. A simple example would be eyewitness identification studies. Most of these studies tend to be done in a university setting, often with a fairly simple array of faces to look at, rather than a line up. The length of time between seeing the criminal and being asked to identify the suspect in the line up is usually shorter. The crime isnt real so theres no chance of the witness being scared, and there are no police officers present so theres not as much chance of feeling pressured. These things all mean that the study definitely lacks ecological validity. They might (but might not) mean that it also lacks external validity. 2.7 Confounds, artifacts and other threats to validity If we look at the issue of validity in the most general fashion the two biggest worries that we have are confounders and artefacts. These two terms are defined in the following way: Confounder: A confounder is an additional, often unmeasured variable[The reason why I say that its unmeasured is that if you have measured it, then you can use some fancy statistical tricks to deal with the confounder. Because of the existence of these statistical solutions to the problem of confounders, we often refer to a confounder that we have measured and dealt with as a covariate. Dealing with covariates is a more advanced topic, but I thought Id mention it in passing since its kind of comforting to at least know that this stuff exists.] that turns out to be related to both the predictors and the outcome. The existence of confounders threatens the internal validity of the study because you cant tell whether the predictor causes the outcome, or if the confounding variable causes it. Artefact: A result is said to be artefactual if it only holds in the special situation that you happened to test in your study. The possibility that your result is an artefact describes a threat to your external validity, because it raises the possibility that you cant generalise or apply your results to the actual population that you care about. As a general rule confounders are a bigger concern for non-experimental studies, precisely because theyre not proper experiments. By definition, youre leaving lots of things uncontrolled, so theres a lot of scope for confounders being present in your study. Experimental research tends to be much less vulnerable to confounders. The more control you have over what happens during the study, the more you can prevent confounders from affecting the results. With random allocation, for example, confounders are distributed randomly, and evenly, between different groups. However, there are always swings and roundabouts and when we start thinking about artefacts rather than confounders the shoe is very firmly on the other foot. For the most part, artefactual results tend to be a concern for experimental studies than for non-experimental studies. To see this, it helps to realise that the reason that a lot of studies are non-experimental is precisely because what the researcher is trying to do is examine human behaviour in a more naturalistic context. By working in a more real-world context you lose experimental control (making yourself vulnerable to confounders), but because you tend to be studying human psychology in the wild you reduce the chances of getting an artefactual result. Or, to put it another way, when you take psychology out of the wild and bring it into the lab (which we usually have to do to gain our experimental control), you always run the risk of accidentally studying something different to what you wanted to study. Be warned though. The above is a rough guide only. Its absolutely possible to have confounders in an experiment, and to get artefactual results with non-experimental studies. This can happen for all sorts of reasons, not least of which is experimenter or researcher error. In practice, its really hard to think everything through ahead of time and even very good researchers make mistakes. Although theres a sense in which almost any threat to validity can be characterised as a confounder or an artefact, theyre pretty vague concepts. So lets have a look at some of the most common examples. 2.7.1 History effects History effects refer to the possibility that specific events may occur during the study that might influence the outcome measure. For instance, something might happen in between a pre-test and a post-test. Or in-between testing participant 23 and participant 24. Alternatively, it might be that youre looking at a paper from an older study that was perfectly valid for its time, but the world has changed enough since then that the conclusions are no longer trustworthy. Examples of things that would count as history effects are: Youre interested in how people think about risk and uncertainty. You started your data collection in December 2010. But finding participants and collecting data takes time, so youre still finding new people in February 2011. Unfortunately for you (and even more unfortunately for others), the Queensland floods occurred in January 2011 causing billions of dollars of damage and killing many people. Not surprisingly, the people tested in February 2011 express quite different beliefs about handling risk than the people tested in December 2010. Which (if any) of these reflects the true beliefs of participants? I think the answer is probably both. The Queensland floods genuinely changed the beliefs of the Australian public, though possibly only temporarily. The key thing here is that the history of the people tested in February is quite different to people tested in December. Youre testing the psychological effects of a new anti-anxiety drug. So what you do is measure anxiety before administering the drug (e.g., by self-report, and taking physiological measures). Then you administer the drug, and afterwards you take the same measures. In the middle however, because your lab is in Los Angeles, theres an earthquake which increases the anxiety of the participants. 2.7.2 Maturation effects As with history effects, maturational effects are fundamentally about change over time. However, maturation effects arent in response to specific events. Rather, they relate to how people change on their own over time. We get older, we get tired, we get bored, etc. Some examples of maturation effects are: When doing developmental psychology research you need to be aware that children grow up quite rapidly. So, suppose that you want to find out whether some educational trick helps with vocabulary size among 3 year olds. One thing that you need to be aware of is that the vocabulary size of children that age is growing at an incredible rate (multiple words per day) all on its own. If you design your study without taking this maturational effect into account, then you wont be able to tell if your educational trick works. When running a very long experiment in the lab (say, something that goes for 3 hours) its very likely that people will begin to get bored and tired, and that this maturational effect will cause performance to decline regardless of anything else going on in the experiment 2.7.3 Repeated testing effects An important type of history effect is the effect of repeated testing. Suppose I want to take two measurements of some psychological construct (e.g., anxiety). One thing I might be worried about is if the first measurement has an effect on the second measurement. In other words, this is a history effect in which the event that influences the second measurement is the first measurement itself! This is not at all uncommon. Examples of this include: Learning and practice: e.g., intelligence at time 2 might appear to go up relative to time 1 because participants learned the general rules of how to solve intelligence-test-style questions during the first testing session. Familiarity with the testing situation: e.g., if people are nervous at time 1, this might make performance go down. But after sitting through the first testing situation they might calm down a lot precisely because theyve seen what the testing looks like. Auxiliary changes caused by testing: e.g., if a questionnaire assessing mood is boring then mood rating at measurement time 2 is more likely to be bored precisely because of the boring measurement made at time 1. 2.7.4 Selection bias Selection bias is a pretty broad term. Suppose that youre running an experiment with two groups of participants where each group gets a different treatment, and you want to see if the different treatments lead to different outcomes. However, suppose that, despite your best efforts, youve ended up with a gender imbalance across groups (say, group A has 80% females and group B has 50% females). It might sound like this could never happen but, trust me, it can. This is an example of a selection bias, in which the people selected into the two groups have different characteristics. If any of those characteristics turns out to be relevant (say, your treatment works better on females than males) then youre in a lot of trouble. 2.7.5 Differential attrition When thinking about the effects of attrition, it is sometimes helpful to distinguish between two different types. The first is homogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is the same for all groups, treatments or conditions. In the example I gave above, the attrition would be homogeneous if (and only if) the easily bored participants are dropping out of all of the conditions in my experiment at about the same rate. In general, the main effect of homogeneous attrition is likely to be that it makes your sample unrepresentative. As such, the biggest worry that youll have is that the generalisability of the results decreases. In other words, you lose external validity. The second type of attrition is heterogeneous attrition, in which the attrition effect is different for different groups. More often called differential attrition, this is a kind of selection bias that is caused by the study itself. Suppose that, for the first time ever in the history of psychology, I manage to find the perfectly balanced and representative sample of people. I start running Danis incredibly long and tedious experiment on my perfect sample but then, because my study is incredibly long and tedious, lots of people start dropping out. I cant stop this. Participants absolutely have the right to stop doing any experiment, any time, for whatever reason they feel like, and as researchers we are morally (and professionally) obliged to remind people that they do have this right. So, suppose that Danis incredibly long and tedious experiment has a very high drop out rate. What do you suppose the odds are that this drop out is random? Answer: zero. Almost certainly the people who remain are more conscientious, more tolerant of boredom, etc., than those that leave. To the extent that (say) conscientiousness is relevant to the psychological phenomenon that I care about, this attrition can decrease the validity of my results. Heres another example. Suppose I design my experiment with two conditions. In the treatment condition, the experimenter insults the participant and then gives them a questionnaire designed to measure obedience. In the control condition, the experimenter engages in a bit of pointless chitchat and then gives them the questionnaire. Leaving aside the questionable scientific merits and dubious ethics of such a study, lets have a think about what might go wrong here. As a general rule, when someone insults me to my face I tend to get much less co-operative. So, theres a pretty good chance that a lot more people are going to drop out of the treatment condition than the control condition. And this drop out isnt going to be random. The people most likely to drop out would probably be the people who dont care all that much about the importance of obediently sitting through the experiment. Since the most bloody minded and disobedient people all left the treatment group but not the control group, weve introduced a confound: the people who actually took the questionnaire in the treatment group were already more likely to be dutiful and obedient than the people in the control group. In short, in this study insulting people doesnt make them more obedient. It makes the more disobedient people leave the experiment! The internal validity of this experiment is completely shot. 2.7.6 Non-response bias Non-response bias is closely related to selection bias and to differential attrition. The simplest version of the problem goes like this. You mail out a survey to 1000 people but only 300 of them reply. The 300 people who replied are almost certainly not a random subsample. People who respond to surveys are systematically different to people who dont. This introduces a problem when trying to generalise from those 300 people who replied to the population at large, since you now have a very non-random sample. The issue of non-response bias is more general than this, though. Among the (say) 300 people that did respond to the survey, you might find that not everyone answers every question. If (say) 80 people chose not to answer one of your questions, does this introduce problems? As always, the answer is maybe. If the question that wasnt answered was on the last page of the questionnaire, and those 80 surveys were returned with the last page missing, theres a good chance that the missing data isnt a big deal; probably the pages just fell off. However, if the question that 80 people didnt answer was the most confrontational or invasive personal question in the questionnaire, then almost certainly youve got a problem. In essence, what youre dealing with here is whats called the problem of missing data. If the data that is missing was lost randomly, then its not a big problem. If its missing systematically, then it can be a big problem. 2.7.7 Regression to the mean Regression to the mean refers to any situation where you select data based on an extreme value on some measure. Because the variable has natural variation it almost certainly means that when you take a subsequent measurement the later measurement will be less extreme than the first one, purely by chance. Heres an example. Suppose Im interested in whether a psychology education has an adverse effect on very smart kids. To do this, I find the 20 psychology I students with the best high school grades and look at how well theyre doing at university. It turns out that theyre doing a lot better than average, but theyre not topping the class at university even though they did top their classes at high school. Whats going on? The natural first thought is that this must mean that the psychology classes must be having an adverse effect on those students. However, while that might very well be the explanation, its more likely that what youre seeing is an example of regression to the mean. To see how it works, lets take a moment to think about what is required to get the best mark in a class, regardless of whether that class be at high school or at university. When youve got a big class there are going to be lots of very smart people enrolled. To get the best mark you have to be very smart, work very hard, and be a bit lucky. The exam has to ask just the right questions for your idiosyncratic skills, and you have to avoid making any dumb mistakes (we all do that sometimes) when answering them. And thats the thing, whilst intelligence and hard work are transferable from one class to the next, luck isnt. The people who got lucky in high school wont be the same as the people who get lucky at university. Thats the very definition of luck. The consequence of this is that when you select people at the very extreme values of one measurement (the top 20 students), youre selecting for hard work, skill and luck. But because the luck doesnt transfer to the second measurement (only the skill and work), these people will all be expected to drop a little bit when you measure them a second time (at university). So their scores fall back a little bit, back towards everyone else. This is regression to the mean. Regression to the mean is surprisingly common. For instance, if two very tall people have kids their children will tend to be taller than average but not as tall as the parents. The reverse happens with very short parents. Two very short parents will tend to have short children, but nevertheless those kids will tend to be taller than the parents. It can also be extremely subtle. For instance, there have been studies done that suggested that people learn better from negative feedback than from positive feedback. However, the way that people tried to show this was to give people positive reinforcement whenever they did good, and negative reinforcement when they did bad. And what you see is that after the positive reinforcement people tended to do worse, but after the negative reinforcement they tended to do better. But notice that theres a selection bias here! When people do very well, youre selecting for high values, and so you should expect, because of regression to the mean, that performance on the next trial should be worse regardless of whether reinforcement is given. Similarly, after a bad trial, people will tend to improve all on their own. The apparent superiority of negative feedback is an artefact caused by regression to the mean (see Kahneman and Tversky 1973 for discussion). 2.7.8 Experimenter bias Experimenter bias can come in multiple forms. The basic idea is that the experimenter, despite the best of intentions, can accidentally end up influencing the results of the experiment by subtly communicating the right answer or the desired behaviour to the participants. Typically, this occurs because the experimenter has special knowledge that the participant does not, for example the right answer to the questions being asked or knowledge of the expected pattern of performance for the condition that the participant is in. The classic example of this happening is the case study of Clever Hans, which dates back to 1907 (Pfungst 1911; Hothersall 2004). Clever Hans was a horse that apparently was able to read and count and perform other human like feats of intelligence. After Clever Hans became famous, psychologists started examining his behaviour more closely. It turned out that, not surprisingly, Hans didnt know how to do maths. Rather, Hans was responding to the human observers around him, because the humans did know how to count and the horse had learned to change its behaviour when people changed theirs. The general solution to the problem of experimenter bias is to engage in double blind studies, where neither the experimenter nor the participant knows which condition the participant is in or knows what the desired behaviour is. This provides a very good solution to the problem, but its important to recognise that its not quite ideal, and hard to pull off perfectly. For instance, the obvious way that I could try to construct a double blind study is to have one of my Ph.D. students (one who doesnt know anything about the experiment) run the study. That feels like it should be enough. The only person (me) who knows all the details (e.g., correct answers to the questions, assignments of participants to conditions) has no interaction with the participants, and the person who does all the talking to people (the Ph.D. student) doesnt know anything. Except for the reality that the last part is very unlikely to be true. In order for the Ph.D. student to run the study effectively they need to have been briefed by me, the researcher. And, as it happens, the Ph.D. student also knows me and knows a bit about my general beliefs about people and psychology (e.g., I tend to think humans are much smarter than psychologists give them credit for). As a result of all this, its almost impossible for the experimenter to avoid knowing a little bit about what expectations I have. And even a little bit of knowledge can have an effect. Suppose the experimenter accidentally conveys the fact that the participants are expected to do well in this task. Well, theres a thing called the Pygmalion effect, where if you expect great things of people theyll tend to rise to the occasion. But if you expect them to fail then theyll do that too. In other words, the expectations become a self-fulfilling prophesy. 2.7.9 Demand effects and reactivity When talking about experimenter bias, the worry is that the experimenters knowledge or desires for the experiment are communicated to the participants, and that these can change peoples behaviour (Rosenthal 1966). However, even if you manage to stop this from happening, its almost impossible to stop people from knowing that theyre part of a psychological study. And the mere fact of knowing that someone is watching or studying you can have a pretty big effect on behaviour. This is generally referred to as reactivity or demand effects. The basic idea is captured by the Hawthorne effect: people alter their performance because of the attention that the study focuses on them. The effect takes its name from a study that took place in the Hawthorne Works factory outside of Chicago (see Adair 1984). This study, from the 1920s, looked at the effects of factory lighting on worker productivity. But, importantly, change in worker behaviour occurred because the workers knew they were being studied, rather than any effect of factory lighting. To get a bit more specific about some of the ways in which the mere fact of being in a study can change how people behave, it helps to think like a social psychologist and look at some of the roles that people might adopt during an experiment but might not adopt if the corresponding events were occurring in the real world: The good participant tries to be too helpful to the researcher. He or she seeks to figure out the experimenters hypotheses and confirm them. The negative participant does the exact opposite of the good participant. He or she seeks to break or destroy the study or the hypothesis in some way. The faithful participant is unnaturally obedient. He or she seeks to follow instructions perfectly, regardless of what might have happened in a more realistic setting. The apprehensive participant gets nervous about being tested or studied, so much so that his or her behaviour becomes highly unnatural, or overly socially desirable. 2.7.10 Placebo effects The placebo effect is a specific type of demand effect that we worry a lot about. It refers to the situation where the mere fact of being treated causes an improvement in outcomes. The classic example comes from clinical trials. If you give people a completely chemically inert drug and tell them that its a cure for a disease, they will tend to get better faster than people who arent treated at all. In other words, it is peoples belief that they are being treated that causes the improved outcomes, not the drug. However, the current consensus in medicine is that true placebo effects are quite rare and most of what was previously considered placebo effect is in fact some combination of natural healing (some people just get better on their own), regression to the mean and other quirks of study design. Of interest to psychology is that the strongest evidence for at least some placebo effect is in self-reported outcomes, most notably in treatment of pain (Hróbjartsson and Gøtzsche 2010). 2.7.11 Situation, measurement and subpopulation effects In some respects, these terms are a catch-all term for all other threats to external validity. They refer to the fact that the choice of sub-population from which you draw your participants, the location, timing and manner in which you run your study (including who collects the data) and the tools that you use to make your measurements might all be influencing the results. Specifically, the worry is that these things might be influencing the results in such a way that the results wont generalise to a wider array of people, places and measures. 2.7.12 Fraud, deception and self-deception It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.  Upton Sinclair Theres one final thing I feel I should mention. While reading what the textbooks often have to say about assessing the validity of a study I couldnt help but notice that they seem to make the assumption that the researcher is honest. I find this hilarious. While the vast majority of scientists are honest, in my experience at least, some are not.11 Not only that, as I mentioned earlier, scientists are not immune to belief bias. Its easy for a researcher to end up deceiving themselves into believing the wrong thing, and this can lead them to conduct subtly flawed research and then hide those flaws when they write it up. So you need to consider not only the (probably unlikely) possibility of outright fraud, but also the (probably quite common) possibility that the research is unintentionally slanted. I opened a few standard textbooks and didnt find much of a discussion of this problem, so heres my own attempt to list a few ways in which these issues can arise: Data fabrication. Sometimes, people just make up the data. This is occasionally done with good intentions. For instance, the researcher believes that the fabricated data do reflect the truth, and may actually reflect slightly cleaned up versions of actual data. On other occasions, the fraud is deliberate and malicious. Some high-profile examples where data fabrication has been alleged or shown include Cyril Burt (a psychologist who is thought to have fabricated some of his data), Andrew Wakefield (who has been accused of fabricating his data connecting the MMR vaccine to autism) and Hwang Woo-suk (who falsified a lot of his data on stem cell research). Hoaxes. Hoaxes share a lot of similarities with data fabrication, but they differ in the intended purpose. A hoax is often a joke, and many of them are intended to be (eventually) discovered. Often, the point of a hoax is to discredit someone or some field. Theres quite a few well known scientific hoaxes that have occurred over the years (e.g., Piltdown man) and some were deliberate attempts to discredit particular fields of research (e.g., the Sokal affair). Data misrepresentation. While fraud gets most of the headlines, its much more common in my experience to see data being misrepresented. When I say this Im not referring to newspapers getting it wrong (which they do, almost always). Im referring to the fact that often the data dont actually say what the researchers think they say. My guess is that, almost always, this isnt the result of deliberate dishonesty but instead is due to a lack of sophistication in the data analyses. For instance, think back to the example of Simpsons paradox that I discussed in the beginning of this book. Its very common to see people present aggregated data of some kind and sometimes, when you dig deeper and find the raw data yourself you find that the aggregated data tell a different story to the disaggregated data. Alternatively, you might find that some aspect of the data is being hidden, because it tells an inconvenient story (e.g., the researcher might choose not to refer to a particular variable). Theres a lot of variants on this, many of which are very hard to detect. Study misdesign. Okay, this one is subtle. Basically, the issue here is that a researcher designs a study that has built-in flaws and those flaws are never reported in the paper. The data that are reported are completely real and are correctly analysed, but they are produced by a study that is actually quite wrongly put together. The researcher really wants to find a particular effect and so the study is set up in such a way as to make it easy to (artefactually) observe that effect. One sneaky way to do this, in case youre feeling like dabbling in a bit of fraud yourself, is to design an experiment in which its obvious to the participants what theyre supposed to be doing, and then let reactivity work its magic for you. If you want you can add all the trappings of double blind experimentation but it wont make a difference since the study materials themselves are subtly telling people what you want them to do. When you write up the results the fraud wont be obvious to the reader. Whats obvious to the participant when theyre in the experimental context isnt always obvious to the person reading the paper. Of course, the way Ive described this makes it sound like its always fraud. Probably there are cases where this is done deliberately, but in my experience the bigger concern has been with unintentional misdesign. The researcher believes and so the study just happens to end up with a built in flaw, and that flaw then magically erases itself when the study is written up for publication. Data mining &amp; post hoc hypothesising. Another way in which the authors of a study can more or less misrepresent the data is by engaging in whats referred to as data mining (see Andrew Gelman and Loken 2014 for a broader discussion of this as part of the garden of forking paths in statistical analysis). As well discuss later, if you keep trying to analyse your data in lots of different ways, youll eventually find something that looks like a real effect but isnt. This is referred to as data mining. It used to be quite rare because data analysis used to take weeks, but now that everyone has very powerful statistical software on their computers its becoming very common. Data mining per se isnt wrong, but the more that you do it the bigger the risk youre taking. The thing that is wrong, and I suspect is very common, is unacknowledged data mining. That is, the researcher runs every possible analysis known to humanity, finds the one that works, and then pretends that this was the only analysis that they ever conducted. Worse yet, they often invent a hypothesis after looking at the data to cover up the data mining. To be clear. Its not wrong to change your beliefs after looking at the data, and to reanalyse your data using your new post hoc hypotheses. What is wrong (and I suspect common) is failing to acknowledge that youve done. If you acknowledge that you did it then other researchers are able to take your behaviour into account. If you dont, then they cant. And that makes your behaviour deceptive. Bad! Publication bias &amp; self-censoring. Finally, a pervasive bias is non-reporting of negative results. This is almost impossible to prevent. Journals dont publish every article that is submitted to them. They prefer to publish articles that find something. So, if 20 people run an experiment looking at whether reading Finnegans Wake causes insanity in humans, and 19 of them find that it doesnt, which one do you think is going to get published? Obviously, its the one study that did find that Finnegans Wake causes insanity.12 This is an example of a publication bias. Since no-one ever published the 19 studies that didnt find an effect, a naive reader would never know that they existed. Worse yet, most researchers internalise this bias and end up self-censoring their research. Knowing that negative results arent going to be accepted for publication, they never even try to report them. As a friend of mine says for every experiment that you get published, you also have 10 failures. And shes right. The catch is, while some (maybe most) of those studies are failures for boring reasons (e.g. you stuffed something up) others might be genuine null results that you ought to acknowledge when you write up the good experiment. And telling which is which is often hard to do. A good place to start is a paper by Ioannidis (2005) with the depressing title Why most published research findings are false. Id also suggest taking a look at work by Kühberger, Fritz, and Scherndl (2014) presenting statistical evidence that this actually happens in psychology. Theres probably a lot more issues like this to think about, but thatll do to start with. What I really want to point out is the blindingly obvious truth that real world science is conducted by actual humans, and only the most gullible of people automatically assumes that everyone else is honest and impartial. Actual scientists arent usually that naive, but for some reason the world likes to pretend that we are, and the textbooks we usually write seem to reinforce that stereotype. 2.8 Summary This chapter isnt really meant to provide a comprehensive discussion of psychological research methods. It would require another volume just as long as this one to do justice to the topic. However, in real life statistics and study design are so tightly intertwined that its very handy to discuss some of the key topics. In this chapter, Ive briefly discussed the following topics: Introduction to psychological measurement. (Section 2.1) What does it mean to operationalise a theoretical construct? What does it mean to have variables and take measurements? Scales of measurement and types of variables. (Section 2.2) Remember that there are two different distinctions here. Theres the difference between discrete and continuous data, and theres the difference between the four different scale types (nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio). Reliability of a measurement. (Section 2.3) If I measure the same thing twice, should I expect to see the same result? Only if my measure is reliable. But what does it mean to talk about doing the same thing? Well, thats why we have different types of reliability. Make sure you remember what they are. Terminology: predictors and outcomes. (Section 2.4) What roles do variables play in an analysis? Can you remember the difference between predictors and outcomes? Dependent and independent variables? Etc. Experimental and non-experimental research designs. (Section 2.5) What makes an experiment an experiment? Is it a nice white lab coat, or does it have something to do with researcher control over variables? Validity and its threats. (Section 2.6) Does your study measure what you want it to? How might things go wrong? And is it my imagination, or was that a very long list of possible ways in which things can go wrong? All this should make clear to you that study design is a critical part of research methodology. I built this chapter from the classic little book by Campbell and Stanley (1963), but there are of course a large number of textbooks out there on research design. Spend a few minutes with your favourite search engine and youll find dozens. References "],["part-ii.-an-introduction-to-jamovi.html", "Part II. An introduction to jamovi", " Part II.

Roger Zelazny13 In this chapter Ill discuss how to get started in jamovi. Ill briefly talk about how to download and install jamovi, but most of the chapter will be focused on getting you started with finding your way around the jamovi GUI. Our goal in this chapter is not to learn any statistical concepts: were just trying to learn the basics of how jamovi works and get comfortable interacting with the system. To do this well spend a bit of time looking at datasets and variables. In doing so, youll get a bit of a feel for what its like to work in jamovi. However, before going into any of the specifics, its worth talking a little about why you might want to use jamovi at all. Given that youre reading this youve probably got your own reasons. However, if those reasons are because thats what my stats class uses, it might be worth explaining a little why your lecturer has chosen to use jamovi for the class. Of course, I dont really know why other people choose jamovi so Im really talking about why I use it. Its sort of obvious but worth saying anyway: doing your statistics on a computer is faster, easier and more powerful than doing statistics by hand. Computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks, and a lot of statistical calculations are both mindless and repetitive. For most people the only reason to ever do statistical calculations with pencil and paper is for learning purposes. In my class I do occasionally suggest doing some calculations that way, but the only real value to it is pedagogical. It does help you to get a feel for statistics to do some calculations yourself, so its worth doing it once. But only once! Doing statistics in a conventional spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) is generally a bad idea in the long run. Although many people likely feel more familiar with them, spreadsheets are very limited in terms of what analyses they allow you do. If you get into the habit of trying to do your real life data analysis using spreadsheets then youve dug yourself into a very deep hole. Avoiding proprietary software is a very good idea. There are a lot of commercial packages out there that you can buy, some of which I like and some of which I dont. Theyre usually very glossy in their appearance and generally very powerful (much more powerful than spreadsheets). However, theyre also very expensive. Usually, the company sells student versions (crippled versions of the real thing) very cheaply, and then they they sell full powered educational versions at a price that makes me wince. They will also sell commercial licences with a staggeringly high price tag. The business model here is to suck you in during your student days and then leave you dependent on their tools when you go out into the real world. Its hard to blame them for trying, but personally Im not in favour of shelling out thousands of dollars if I can avoid it. And you can avoid it. If you make use of packages like jamovi that are open source and free you never get trapped having to pay exorbitant licensing fees. Something that you might not appreciate now, but will love later on if you do anything involving data analysis, is the fact that jamovi is basically a sophisticated front end for the free R statistical programming language. When you download and install R you get all the basic packages and those are very powerful on their own. However, because R is so open and so widely used, its become something of a standard tool in statistics and so lots of people write their own packages that extend the system. And these are freely available too. One of the consequences of this, Ive noticed, is that if you look at recent advanced data analysis textbooks then a lot of them use R. Those are the main reasons I use jamovi. Its not without its flaws, though. Its relatively new14 so there is not a huge set of textbooks and other resources to support it, and it has a few annoying quirks that were all pretty much stuck with, but on the whole I think the strengths outweigh the weakness; more so than any other option Ive encountered so far. 3.1 Installing jamovi Okay, enough with the sales pitch. Lets get started. Just as with any piece of software, jamovi needs to be installed on a computer, which is a magical box that does cool things and delivers free ponies. Or something along those lines; I may be confusing computers with the iPad marketing campaigns. Anyway, jamovi is freely distributed online and you can download it from the jamovi homepage, which is: https://www.jamovi.org/ At the top of the page, under the heading Download, youll see separate links for Windows users, Mac users, and Linux users. If you follow the relevant link youll see that the online instructions are pretty self-explanatory. As of this writing, the current version of jamovi is 0.9, but they usually issue updates every few months, so youll probably have a newer version.15 3.1.1 Starting up jamovi One way or another, regardless of what operating system youre using, its time to open jamovi and get started. When first starting jamovi you will be presented with a user interface which looks something like Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: jamovi looks like this when you start it To the left is the spreadsheet view, and to the right is where the results of statistical tests appear. Down the middle is a bar separating these two regions and this can be dragged to the left or the right to change their sizes. It is possible to simply begin typing values into the jamovi spreadsheet as you would in any other spreadsheet software. Alternatively, existing data sets in the CSV (.csv) file format can be opened in jamovi. Additionally, you can easily import SPSS, SAS, Stata and JASP files directly into jamovi. To open a file select the File tab (three horizontal lines signify this tab) at the top left hand corner, select Open and then choose from the files listed on Browse depending on whether you want to open an example or a file stored on your computer. 3.2 Analyses Analyses can be selected from the analysis ribbon or menu along the top. Selecting an analysis will present an options panel for that particular analysis, allowing you to assign different variables to different parts of the analysis, and select different options. At the same time, the results for the analysis will appear in the right Results panel and will update in real-time as you make changes to the options. When you have the analysis set up correctly you can dismiss the analysis options by clicking the arrow to the top right of the optional panel. If you wish to return to these options, you can click on the results that were produced. In this way, you can return to any analysis that you (or say, a colleague) created earlier. If you decide you no longer need a particular analysis, you can remove it with the results context menu. Right-clicking on the analysis results will bring up a menu and by selecting Analysis and then Remove the analysis can be removed. But more on this later. First, lets take a more detailed look at the spreadsheet view. 3.3 The spreadsheet In jamovi data is represented in a spreadsheet with each column representing a variable and each row representing a case or participant. 3.3.1 Variables The most commonly used variables in jamovi are Data Variables, these variables simply contain data either loaded from a data file, or typed in by the user. Data variables can be one of three measurement levels: These levels are designated by the symbol in the header of the variables column. The ID variable type is unique to jamovi. Its intended for variables that contain identifiers that you would almost never want to analyse. For example, a persons name, or a participant ID. Specifying an ID variable type can improve performance when interacting with very large data sets. Nominal variables are for categorical variables which are text labels, for example a column called Gender with the values Male and Female would be nominal. So would a persons name. Nominal variable values can also have a numeric value. These variables are used most often when importing data which codes values with numbers rather than text. For example, a column in a dataset may contain the values 1 for males, and 2 for females. It is possible to add nice human-readable labels to these values with the variable editor (more on this later). Ordinal variables are like Nominal variables, except the values have a specific order. An example is a Likert scale with 3 being strongly agree and -3 being strongly disagree. Continuous variables are variables which exist on a continuous scale. Examples might be height or weight. This is also referred to as Interval or Ratio scale. In addition, you can also specify different data types: variables have a data type of either Text, Integer or Decimal. When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in the variable type will change automatically depending on the data you enter. This is a good way to get a feel for which variable types go with which sorts of data. Similarly, when opening a data file jamovi will try and guess the variable type from the data in each column. In both cases this automatic approach may not be correct, and it may be necessary to manually specify the variable type with the variable editor. The variable editor can be opened by selecting Setup from the data tab or by double-clicking on the variable column header. The variable editor allows you to change the name of the variable and, for data variables, the variable type, the order of the levels, and the label displayed for each level. Changes can be applied by clicking the tick to the top right. The variable editor can be dismissed by clicking the Hide arrow. New variables can be inserted or appended to the data set using the add button from the data ribbon. The add button also allows the addition of computed variables. 3.3.2 Computed variables Computed Variables are those which take their value by performing a computation on other variables. Computed Variables can be used for a range of purposes, including log transforms, z-scores, sum-scores, negative scoring and means. Computed variables can be added to the data set with the add button available on the data tab. This will produce a formula box where you can specify the formula. The usual arithmetic operators are available. Some examples of formulas are: A + B LOG10(len) MEAN(A, B) (dose - VMEAN(dose)) / VSTDEV(dose) In order, these are the sum of A and B, a log (base 10) transform of len, the mean of A and B, and the z-score of the variable dose. Figure 3.2 below shows the jamovi screen for the new variable computed as the z-score of dose (from the Tooth Growth example data set). Figure 3.2: A newly computed variable, the z-score of dose V-functions Several functions are already available in jamovi and available from the drop down box labelled fx. A number of functions appear in pairs, one prefixed with a V and the other not. V functions perform their calculation on a variable as a whole, where as non-V functions perform their calculation row by row. For example, MEAN(A, B) will produce the mean of A and B for each row. Where as VMEAN(A) gives the mean of all the values in A. 3.3.3 Copy and Paste jamovi produces nice American Psychological Association (APA) formatted tables and attractive plots. It is often useful to be able to copy and paste these, perhaps into a Word document, or into an email to a colleague. To copy results right click on the object of interest and from the menu select exactly what you want to copy. The menu allows you to choose to copy only the image or the entire analysis. Selecting copy copies the content to the clipboard and this can be pasted into other programs in the usual way. You can practice this later on when we do some analyses. 3.3.4 Syntax mode jamovi also provides an R Syntax Mode. In this mode jamovi produces equivalent R code for each analysis. To change to syntax mode, select the Application menu to the top right of jamovi (a button with three vertical dots) and click the Syntax mode checkbox there. You can turn off syntax mode by clicking this a second time. In syntax mode analyses continue to operate as before but now they produce R syntax, and ascii output like an R session. Like all results objects in jamovi, you can right click on these items (including the R syntax) and copy and paste them, for example into an R session. At present, the provided R syntax does not include the data import step and so this must be performed manually in R. There are many resources explaining how to import data into R and if you are interested we recommend you take a look at these; just search on the interweb. 3.4 Loading data in jamovi There are several different types of files that are likely to be relevant to us when doing data analysis. There are two in particular that are especially important from the perspective of this book: jamovi files are those with a .omv file extension. This is the standard kind of file that jamovi uses to store data, and variables and analyses. Comma separated value (csv) files} are those with a .csv file extension. These are just regular old text files and they can be opened with many different software programs. Its quite typical for people to store data in csv files, precisely because theyre so simple. There are also several other kinds of data file that you might want to import into jamovi. For instance, you might want to open Microsoft Excel spreadsheets .xls files), or data files that have been saved in the native file formats for other statistics software, such as SPSS or SAS. Whichever file formats you are using, its a good idea to create a folder or folders especially for your jamovi data sets and analyses and to make sure you keep these backed up regularly. 3.4.1 Importing data from csv files One quite commonly used data format is the humble comma separated value file, also called a csv file, and usually bearing the file extension .csv. csv files are just plain old-fashioned text files and what they store is basically just a table of data. This is illustrated in Figure 3.3, which shows a file called booksales.csv that Ive created. As you can see, each row represents the book sales data for one month. The first row doesnt contain actual data though, it has the names of the variables. Figure 3.3: The booksales.csv data file. On the left Ive opened the file using a spreadsheet program (OpenOffice), which shows that the file is basically a table. On the right the same file is open in a standard text editor (the TextEdit program on a Mac), which shows how the file is formatted. The entries in the table are wrapped in quote marks and separated by commas. Its easy to open csv files in jamovi. From the top left menu (the button with three parallel lines) choose Open and browse to where you have stored the csv file on your computer. If youre on a Mac, itll look like the usual Finder window that you use to choose a file; on Windows it looks like an Explorer window. An example of what it looks like on a Mac is shown in Figure (fig:fileopen). Im assuming that youre familiar with your own computer, so you should have no problem finding the csv file that you want to import! Find the one you want, then click on the Open button. Figure 3.4: A dialog box on a Mac asking you to select the csv file jamovi should try to import. Mac users will recognise this immediately, its the usual way in which a Mac asks you to find a file. Windows users wont see this, instead theyll see the usual explorer window that Windows always gives you when it wants you to select a file. There are a few things that you can check to make sure that the data gets imported correctly: Heading. Does the first row of the file contain the names for each variable - a header row? The booksales.csv file has a header, so thats a yes. Separator. What character is used to separate different entries? In most csv files this will be a comma (it is comma separated after all). Decimal. What character is used to specify the decimal point? In English speaking countries this is almost always a period (i.e., .). Thats not universally true though, many European countries use a comma. Quote. What character is used to denote a block of text? Thats usually going to be a double quote mark \". It is for the booksales.csv file. 3.5 Importing unusual data files Throughout this book Ive assumed that your data are stored as a jamovi .omv file or as a properly formatted csv file. However, in real life thats not a terribly plausible assumption to make so Id better talk about some of the other possibilities that you might run into. 3.5.1 Loading data from text files The first thing I should point out is that if your data are saved as a text file but arent quite in the proper csv format then theres still a pretty good chance that jamovi will be able to open it. You just need to try it and see if it works. Sometimes though you will need to change some of the formatting. The ones that Ive often found myself needing to change are: header. A lot of the time when youre storing data as a csv file the first row actually contains the column names and not data. If thats not true then its a good idea to open up the csv file in a spreadsheet programme such as Open Office and add the header row manually. sep. As the name comma separated value indicates, the values in a row of a csv file are usually separated by commas. This isnt universal, however. In Europe the decimal point is typically written as , instead of . and as a consequence it would be somewhat awkward to use , as the separator. Therefore it is not unusual to use ; instead of , as the separator. At other times, Ive seen a TAB character used. quote. Its conventional in csv files to include a quoting character for textual data. As you can see by looking at the booksales.csv file, this is usually a double quote character, \". But sometimes there is no quoting character at all, or you might see a single quote mark ' used instead. skip. Its actually very common to receive CSV files in which the first few rows have nothing to do with the actual data. Instead, they provide a human readable summary of where the data came from, or maybe they include some technical info that doesnt relate to the data. missing values. Often youll get given data with missing values. For one reason or another, some entries in the table are missing. The data file needs to include a special value to indicate that the entry is missing. By default jamovi assumes that this value is 9916, for both numeric and text data, so you should make sure that, where necessary, all missing values in the csv file are replaced with 99 (or -9999; whichever you choose) before opening / importing the file into jamovi. Once you have opened / imported the file into jamovi all the missing values are converted to blank cells in the jamovi spreadsheet view. 3.5.2 Loading data from SPSS (and other statistics packages) The commands listed above are the main ones well need for data files in this book. But in real life we have many more possibilities. For example, you might want to read data files in from other statistics programs. Since SPSS is probably the most widely used statistics package in psychology, its worth mentioning that jamovi can also import SPSS data files (file extension .sav). Just follow the instructions above for how to open a csv file, but this time navigate to the .sav file you want to import. For SPSS files, jamovi will regard all values as missing if they are regarded as system missing files in SPSS. The Default missings value does not seem to work as expected when importing SPSS files, so be aware of this - you might need another step: import the SPSS file into jamovi, then export as a csv file before re-opening in jamovi.17. And thats pretty much it, at least as far as SPSS goes. As far as other statistical software goes, jamovi can also directly open / import SAS and STATA files. 3.5.3 Loading Excel files A different problem is posed by Excel files. Despite years of yelling at people for sending data to me encoded in a proprietary data format, I get sent a lot of Excel files. The way to handle Excel files is to open them up first in Excel or another spreadsheet programme that can handle Excel files, and then export the data as a csv file before opening / importing the csv file into jamovi. 3.6 Changing data from one level to another Sometimes you want to change the variable level. This can happen for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes when you import data from files, it can come to you in the wrong format. Numbers sometimes get imported as nominal, text values. Dates may get imported as text. ParticipantID values can sometimes be read as continuous: nominal values can sometimes be read as ordinal or even continuous. Theres a good chance that sometimes youll want to convert a variable from one measurement level into another one. Or, to use the correct term, you want to coerce the variable from one class into another. In 3.3 we saw how to specify different variable levels, and if you want to change a variables measurement level then you can do this in the jamovi data view for that variable. Just click the check box for the measurement level you want - continuous, ordinal, or nominal. 3.7 Installing add-on modules into jamovi A really great feature of jamovi is the ability to install add-on modules from the jamovi library. These add-on modules have been developed by the jamovi community, i.e., jamovi users and developers who have created special software add-ons that do other, usually more advanced, analyses that go beyond the capabilities of the base jamovi program. To install add-on modules, just click on the large + in the top right of the jamovi window, select jamovi-library and then browse through the various add-on modules that are available. Choose the one(s) you want, and then install them, as in Figure 3.5. Its that easy. The newly installed modules can then be accessed from the Analyses button bar. Try ituseful add-on modules to install include scatr (added under Descriptives) and R j. Figure 3.5: Installing add-on modules in jamovi 3.8 Quitting jamovi Theres one last thing I should cover in this chapter: how to quit jamovi. Its not hard, just close the program the same way you would any other program. However, what you might want to do before you quit is save your work! There are two parts to this: saving any changes to the data set, and saving the analyses that you ran. It is good practice to save any changes to the data set as a new data set. That way you can always go back to the original data. To save any changes in jamovi, select ExportData from the main jamovi menu (button with three horizontal bars in the top left) and create a new file name for the changed data set. Alternatively, you can save both the changed data and any analyses you have undertaken by saving as a jamovi file. To do this, from the main jamovi menu select Save as and type in a file name for this jamovi file (.omv). Remember to save the file in a location where you can find it again later. I usually create a new folder for specific data sets and analyses. 3.9 Summary Section 3.1. We downloaded and installed jamovi, and started it up. Section 3.2. We very briefly oriented to the part of jamovi where analyses are done and results appear, but then deferred this until later in the book. Section 3.3. We spent more time looking at the spreadsheet part of jamovi, and considered different variable types, and how to compute new variables. Section 3.4. We also saw how to load data files in jamovi. Section 3.5. Then we figured out how to open other data files, from different file types. Section 3.6. And saw that sometimes we need to coerce data from one type to another. Section 3.7. Installing add-on modules from the jamovi community really extends jamovi capabilities. Section 3.8. Finally, we looked at good practice in terms of saving your data set and analyses when you have finished and are about to quit jamovi. Source: Dismal Light (1968) As of writing this in August 2018. Although jamovi is updated frequently it doesnt usually make much of a difference for the sort of work well do in this book. In fact, during the writing of the book I upgraded several times and it didnt make much difference at all to what is in this book. You can change the default value for missing values in jamovi from the top right menu (three vertical dots), but this only works at the time of importing data files into jamovi. The default missing value in the dataset should not be a valid number associated with any of the variables, e.g. you could use -9999 as this is unlikely to be a valid value. I know this is a bot of a fudge, but it does work and hopefully this will be fixed in a later version of jamovi. "],["part-iii.-working-with-data.html", "Part III. Working with data", " Part III.

This is what descriptive statistics (as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people the term statistics is synonymous with descriptive statistics. It is this topic that well consider in this chapter, but before going into any details, lets take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To do this, lets open the aflsmall_margins file and see what variables are stored in the file. Figure 4.1: A screenshot of jamovi showing the variables stored in the aflsmall_margins.csv file In fact, there is just one variable here, afl.margins. Well focus a bit on this variable in this chapter, so Id better tell you what it is. Unlike most of the data sets in this book, this is actually real data, relating to the Australian Football League (AFL).18 The afl.margins variable contains the winning margin (number of points) for all 176 home and away games played during the 2010 season. This output doesnt make it easy to get a sense of what the data are actually saying. Just looking at the data isnt a terribly effective way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what the data are actually saying we need to calculate some descriptive statistics (this chapter) and draw some nice pictures (Chapter 5). Since the descriptive statistics are the easier of the two topics Ill start with those, but nevertheless Ill show you a histogram of the afl.margins data since it should help you get a sense of what the data were trying to describe actually look like, see Figure 4.2. Well talk a lot more about how to draw histograms in Section ??. For now, its enough to look at the histogram and note that it provides a fairly interpretable representation of the afl.margins data. Figure 4.2: A histogram of the AFL 2010 winning margin data (the afl.margins variable). As you might expect, the larger the winning margin the less frequently you tend to see it. 4.1 Measures of central tendency Drawing pictures of the data, as I did in Figure 4.2, is an excellent way to convey the gist of what the data is trying to tell you. Its often extremely useful to try to condense the data into a few simple  statistics. In most situations, the first thing that youll want to calculate is a measure of central tendency. That is, youd like to know something about where the average or middle of your data lies. The three most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode. Ill explain each of these in turn, and then discuss when each of them is useful. 4.1.1 The mean The mean of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned average. Add all of the values up, and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL winning margins were 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32, so the mean of these observations is just: \\[ \\frac{56 + 31 + 56 + 8 + 32}{5} = \\frac{183}{5} = 36.60 \\] Of course, this definition of the mean isnt news to anyone. Averages (i.e., means) are used so often in everyday life that this is pretty familiar stuff. However, since the concept of a mean is something that everyone already understands, Ill use this as an excuse to start introducing some of the mathematical notation that statisticians use to describe this calculation, and talk about how the calculations would be done in jamovi. The first piece of notation to introduce is \\(N\\), which well use to refer to the number of observations that were averaging (in this case \\(N = 5\\)). Next, we need to attach a label to the observations themselves. Its traditional to use \\(X\\) for this, and to use subscripts to indicate which observation were actually talking about. That is, well use \\(X_1\\) to refer to the first observation, \\(X_2\\) to refer to the second observation, and so on all the way up to \\(X_N\\) for the last one. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly more abstract way, we use \\(X_i\\) to refer to the \\(i\\)-th observation. Just to make sure were clear on the notation, the following table lists the 5 observations in the afl.margins variable, along with the mathematical symbol used to refer to it and the actual value that the observation corresponds to: Table 4.1: the observation its symbol the observed value winning margin, game 1 \\(X_1\\) 56 points winning margin, game 2 \\(X_2\\) 31 points winning margin, game 3 \\(X_3\\) 56 points winning margin, game 4 \\(X_4\\) 8 points winning margin, game 5 \\(X_5\\) 32 points Okay, now lets try to write a formula for the mean. By tradition, we use \\(\\bar{X}\\) as the notation for the mean. So the calculation for the mean could be expressed using the following formula: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + \\ldots + X_{N-1} + X_N}{N} \\] This formula is entirely correct but its terribly long, so we make use of the summation symbol \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) to shorten it.19 If I want to add up the first five observations I could write out the sum the long way, \\(X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 +X_5\\) or I could use the summation symbol to shorten it to this: \\[ \\sum_{i=1}^5 X_i \\] Taken literally, this could be read as the sum, taken over all \\(i\\) values from 1 to 5, of the value \\(X_i\\). But basically what it means is add up the first five observations. In any case, we can use this notation to write out the formula for the mean, which looks like this: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_i \\] In all honesty, I cant imagine that all this mathematical notation helps clarify the concept of the mean at all. In fact, its really just a fancy way of writing out the same thing I said in words: add all the values up and then divide by the total number of items. However, thats not really the reason I went into all that detail. My goal was to try to make sure that everyone reading this book is clear on the notation that well be using throughout the book: \\(\\bar{X}\\) for the mean, \\(\\scriptstyle\\sum\\) for the idea of summation, \\(X_i\\) for the \\(i\\)th observation, and \\(N\\) for the total number of observations. Were going to be re-using these symbols a fair bit so its important that you understand them well enough to be able to read the equations, and to be able to see that its just saying add up lots of things and then divide by another thing. 4.1.2 Calculating the mean in jamovi Okay, thats the maths. So how do we get the magic computing box to do the work for us? When the number of observations starts to become large its much easier to do these sorts of calculations using a computer. To calculate the mean using all the data we can use jamovi. The first step is to click on the Exploration button and then click Descriptives. Then you can highlight the afl.margins variable and click the right arrow to move it across into the Variables box. As soon as you do that a Table appears on the right hand side of the screen containing default Descriptives information; see Figure 4.3. Figure 4.3: Default descriptives for the AFL 2010 winning margin data (the afl.margins variable). As you can see in Figure 4.3, the mean value for the afl.margins variable is 35.30. Other information presented includes the total number of observations (N=176), the number of missing values (none), and the Median, Minimum and Maximum values for the variable. 4.1.3 The median The second measure of central tendency that people use a lot is the median, and its even easier to describe than the mean. The median of a set of observations is just the middle value. As before lets imagine we were interested only in the first 5 AFL winning margins: 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. To figure out the median we sort these numbers into ascending order: \\[ 8, 31, \\mathbf{32}, 56, 56 \\] From inspection, its obvious that the median value of these 5 observations is 32 since thats the middle one in the sorted list (Ive put it in bold to make it even more obvious). Easy stuff. But what should we do if we are interested in the first 6 games rather than the first 5? Since the sixth game in the season had a winning margin of 14 points, our sorted list is now \\[ 8, 14, \\mathbf{31}, \\mathbf{32}, 56, 56 \\] and there are two middle numbers, 31 and 32. The median is defined as the average of those two numbers, which is of course 31.5. As before, its very tedious to do this by hand when youve got lots of numbers. In real life, of course, no-one actually calculates the median by sorting the data and then looking for the middle value. In real life we use a computer to do the heavy lifting for us, and jamovi has provided us with a Median value of 30.50 for the afl.margins variable (Figure 4.3). 4.1.4 Mean or median? Whats the difference? Knowing how to calculate means and medians is only a part of the story. You also need to understand what each one is saying about the data, and what that implies for when you should use each one. This is illustrated in Figure 4.4. The mean is kind of like the centre of gravity of the data set, whereas the median is the middle value in the data. What this implies, as far as which one you should use, depends a little on what type of data youve got and what youre trying to achieve. As a rough guide: If your data are nominal scale you probably shouldnt be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary then its probably best to use the mode (Section 4.1.6) instead. If your data are ordinal scale youre more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger) but doesnt depend on the precise numbers involved. Thats exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so its not really appropriate for ordinal data. For interval and ratio scale data either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what youre trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you dont have a lot of data). But its very sensitive to extreme, outlying values. Figure 4.4: An illustration of the difference between how the mean and the median should be interpreted. The mean is basically the centre of gravity of the data set. If you imagine that the histogram of the data is a solid object, then the point on which you could balance it (as if on a see-saw) is the mean. In contrast, the median is the middle observation, with half of the observations smaller and half of the observations larger. Lets expand on that last part a little. One consequence is that there are systematic differences between the mean and the median when the histogram is asymmetric (skewed; see Section 4.3). This is illustrated in Figure 4.4. Notice that the median (right hand side) is located closer to the body of the histogram, whereas the mean (left hand side) gets dragged towards the tail (where the extreme values are). To give a concrete example, suppose Bob (income $50,000), Kate (income $60,000) and Jane (income $65,000) are sitting at a table. The average income at the table is $58,333 and the median income is $60,000. Then Bill sits down with them (income $100,000,000). The average income has now jumped to $25,043,750 but the median rises only to $62,500. If youre interested in looking at the overall income at the table the mean might be the right answer. But if youre interested in what counts as a typical income at the table the median would be a better choice here. 4.1.5 A real life example To try to get a sense of why you need to pay attention to the differences between the mean and the median lets consider a real life example. Since I tend to mock journalists for their poor scientific and statistical knowledge, I should give credit where credit is due. This is an excellent article on the ABC news website20 from 24 September, 2010: Senior Commonwealth Bank executives have travelled the world in the past couple of weeks with a presentation showing how Australian house prices, and the key price to income ratios, compare favourably with similar countries. ``Housing affordability has actually been going sideways for the last five to six years, said Craig James, the chief economist of the banks trading arm, CommSec. This probably comes as a huge surprise to anyone with a mortgage, or who wants a mortgage, or pays rent, or isnt completely oblivious to whats been going on in the Australian housing market over the last several years. Back to the article: CBA has waged its war against what it believes are housing doomsayers with graphs, numbers and international comparisons. In its presentation, the bank rejects arguments that Australias housing is relatively expensive compared to incomes. It says Australias house price to household income ratio of 5.6 in the major cities, and 4.3 nationwide, is comparable to many other developed nations. It says San Francisco and New York have ratios of 7, Aucklands is 6.7, and Vancouver comes in at 9.3. More excellent news! Except, the article goes on to make the observation that: Many analysts say that has led the bank to use misleading figures and comparisons. If you go to page four of CBAs presentation and read the source information at the bottom of the graph and table, you would notice there is an additional source on the international comparison  Demographia. However, if the Commonwealth Bank had also used Demographias analysis of Australias house price to income ratio, it would have come up with a figure closer to 9 rather than 5.6 or 4.3 Thats, um, a rather serious discrepancy. One group of people say 9, another says 4-5. Should we just split the difference and say the truth lies somewhere in between? Absolutely not! This is a situation where there is a right answer and a wrong answer. Demographia is correct, and the Commonwealth Bank is wrong. As the article points out: [An] obvious problem with the Commonwealth Banks domestic price to income figures is they compare average incomes with median house prices (unlike the Demographia figures that compare median incomes to median prices). The median is the mid-point, effectively cutting out the highs and lows, and that means the average is generally higher when it comes to incomes and asset prices, because it includes the earnings of Australias wealthiest people. To put it another way: the Commonwealth Banks figures count Ralph Norris multi-million dollar pay packet on the income side, but not his (no doubt) very expensive house in the property price figures, thus understating the house price to income ratio for middle-income Australians. Couldnt have put it better myself. The way that Demographia calculated the ratio is the right thing to do. The way that the Bank did it is incorrect. As for why an extremely quantitatively sophisticated organisation such as a major bank made such an elementary mistake, well I cant say for sure since I have no special insight into their thinking. But the article itself does happen to mention the following facts, which may or may not be relevant: [As] Australias largest home lender, the Commonwealth Bank has one of the biggest vested interests in house prices rising. It effectively owns a massive swathe of Australian housing as security for its home loans as well as many small business loans. My, my. 4.1.6 Mode The mode of a sample is very simple. It is the value that occurs most frequently. We can illustrate the mode using a different AFL variable: who has played in the most finals? Open the aflsmall_finalists file and take a look at the afl.finalists variable, see Figure 4.5. This variable contains the names of all 400 teams that played in all 200 finals matches played during the period 1987 to 2010. Figure 4.5: A screenshot of jamovi showing the variables stored in the aflsmall_finalists.csv file What we could do is read through all 400 entries and count the number of occasions on which each team name appears in our list of finalists, thereby producing a frequency table. However, that would be mindless and boring: exactly the sort of task that computers are great at. So lets use jamovi to do this for us. Under Exploration - Descriptives click the small check box labelled Frequency tables and you should get something like Figure 4.6. Figure 4.6: A screenshot of jamovi showing the frequency table for the afl.finalists variable Now that we have our frequency table we can just look at it and see that, over the 24 years for which we have data, Geelong has played in more finals than any other team. Thus, the mode of the afl.finalists data is \"Geelong\". We can see that Geelong (39 finals) played in more finals than any other team during the 1987-2010 period. Its also worth noting that in the Descriptives Table no results are calculated for Mean, Median, Minimum or Maximum. This is because the afl.finalists variable is a nominal text variable so it makes no sense to calculate these values. One last point to make regarding the mode. Whilst the mode is most often calculated when you have nominal data, because means and medians are useless for those sorts of variables, there are some situations in which you really do want to know the mode of an ordinal, interval or ratio scale variable. For instance, lets go back to our afl.margins variable. This variable is clearly ratio scale (if its not clear to you, it may help to re-read Section 2.2), and so in most situations the mean or the median is the measure of central tendency that you want. But consider this scenario: a friend of yours is offering a bet and they pick a football game at random. Without knowing who is playing you have to guess the exact winning margin. If you guess correctly you win $50. If you dont you lose $1. There are no consolation prizes for almost getting the right answer. You have to guess exactly the right margin. For this bet, the mean and the median are completely useless to you. It is the mode that you should bet on. To calculate the mode for the afl.margins variable in jamovi, go back to that data set and on the Exploration - Descriptives screen you will see you can expand the section marked Statistics. Click on the checkbox marked Mode and you will see the modal value presented in the Descriptives Table, as in Figure 4.7. So the 2010 data suggest you should bet on a 3 point margin. Figure 4.7: A screenshot of jamovi showing the modal value for the afl.margins variable 4.2 Measures of variability The statistics that weve discussed so far all relate to central tendency. That is, they all talk about which values are in the middle or popular in the data. However, central tendency is not the only type of statistic that we want to calculate. The second thing that we really want is a measure of the variability of the data. That is, how spread out are the data? How far away from the mean or median do the observed values tend to be? For now, lets assume that the data are interval or ratio scale, and well continue to use the afl.margins data. Well use this data to discuss several different measures of spread, each with different strengths and weaknesses. 4.2.1 Range The range of a variable is very simple. Its the biggest value minus the smallest value. For the AFL winning margins data the maximum value is 116 and the minimum value is 0. Although the range is the simplest way to quantify the notion of ``variability, its one of the worst. Recall from our discussion of the mean that we want our measure to be robust. If the data set has one or two extremely bad values in it wed like our statistics to not be unduly influenced by these cases. For example, in a variable containing very extreme outliers \\[ -100,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 \\] it is clear that the range is not robust. This variable has a range of 110 but if the outlier were removed we would have a range of only 8. 4.2.2 Interquartile range The interquartile range (IQR) is like the range, but instead of the difference between the biggest and smallest value the difference between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile is taken. If you dont already know what a percentile is, the 10th percentile of a data set is the smallest number \\(x\\) such that 10% of the data is less than \\(x\\). In fact, weve already come across the idea. The median of a data set is its 50th percentile! In jamovi you can easily specify the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles by clicking the checkbox Quartiles in the Exploration - Descriptives - Statistics screen. Figure 4.8: A screenshot of jamovi showing the Quartiles for the afl.margins variable And not surprisingly, in Figure 4.8 the 50th percentile is the same as the median value. And, by noting that \\(50.50 - 12.75 = 37.75\\), we can see that the interquartile range for the 2010 AFL winning margins data is 37.75. While its obvious how to interpret the range its a little less obvious how to interpret the IQR. The simplest way to think about it is like this: the interquartile range is the range spanned by the middle half of the data. That is, one quarter of the data falls below the 25th percentile and one quarter of the data is above the 75th percentile, leaving the middle half of the data lying in between the two. And the IQR is the range covered by that middle half. 4.2.3 Mean absolute deviation The two measures weve looked at so far, the range and the interquartile range, both rely on the idea that we can measure the spread of the data by looking at the percentiles of the data. However, this isnt the only way to think about the problem. A different approach is to select a meaningful reference point (usually the mean or the median) and then report the typical deviations from that reference point. What do we mean by typical deviation? Usually, this is the mean or median value of these deviations. In practice, this leads to two different measures: the mean absolute deviation (from the mean) and the median absolute deviation (from the median). From what Ive read, the measure based on the median seems to be used in statistics and does seem to be the better of the two. But to be honest I dont think Ive seen it used much in psychology. The measure based on the mean does occasionally show up in psychology though. In this section Ill talk about the first one, and Ill come back to talk about the second one later. Since the previous paragraph might sound a little abstract, lets go through the mean absolute deviation from the mean a little more slowly. One useful thing about this measure is that the name actually tells you exactly how to calculate it. Lets think about our AFL winning margins data, and once again well start by pretending that there are only 5 games in total, with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case the mean), the first thing we need to calculate is the mean, \\(\\bar{X}\\). For these five observations, our mean is \\(\\bar{X} = 36.6\\). The next step is to convert each of our observations \\(X_i\\) into a deviation score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation \\(X_i\\) and the mean \\(\\bar{X}\\). That is, the deviation score is defined to be \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\). For the first observation in our sample, this is equal to \\(56 - 36.6 = 19.4\\). Okay, thats simple enough. The next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute deviations, and we do this by converting any negative values to positive ones. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of \\(-3\\) as \\(|-3|\\), and so we say that \\(|-3| = 3\\). We use the absolute value here because we dont really care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than the mean, were just interested in how close it is to the mean. To help make this process as obvious as possible, the table below shows these calculations for all five observations: English: which game value deviation from mean absolute deviation maths: \\(i\\) \\(X_i\\) \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) |\\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\)| 1 56 19.4 19.4 2 31 -5.6 5.6 3 56 19.4 19.4 4 8 28.6 28.6 5 32 -4.6 4.6 Now that we have calculated the absolute deviation score for every observation in the data set, all that we have to do to calculate the mean of these scores. Lets do that: \\[ \\frac{19.4 + 5.6 + 19.4 + 28.6 + 4.6}{5} = 15.52 \\] And were done. The mean absolute deviation for these five scores is 15.52. However, whilst our calculations for this little example are at an end, we do have a couple of things left to talk about. First, we should really try to write down a proper mathematical formula. But in order do to this I need some mathematical notation to refer to the mean absolute deviation. Irritatingly, mean absolute deviation and median absolute deviation have the same acronym (MAD), which leads to a certain amount of ambiguity so Id better come up with something different for the mean absolute deviation. Sigh. What Ill do is use AAD instead, short for average absolute deviation. Now that we have some unambiguous notation, heres the formula that describes what we just calculated: \\[ ~AAD~(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i = 1}^N |X_i - \\bar{X}| \\] 4.2.4 Variance Although the average absolute deviation measure has its uses, its not the best measure of variability to use. From a purely mathematical perspective there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations rather than absolute deviations. If we do that we obtain a measure called the variance, which has a lot of really nice statistical properties that Im going to ignore,21 and one massive psychological flaw that Im going to make a big deal out of in a moment. The variance of a data set \\(X\\) is sometimes written as \\(\\mbox{Var}(X)\\), but its more commonly denoted \\(s^2\\) (the reason for this will become clearer shortly). The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows: \\[ \\mbox{Var}(X) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\] As you can see, its basically the same formula that we used to calculate the average absolute deviation, except that instead of using absolute deviations we use squared deviations. It is for this reason that the variance is sometimes referred to as the mean square deviation. Now that weve got the basic idea, lets have a look at a concrete example. Once again, lets use the first five AFL games as our data. If we follow the same approach that we took last time, we end up with the following table: English: which game value deviation from mean squared deviation maths: \\(i\\) \\(X_i\\) \\(X_i - \\bar{X}\\) \\((X_i - \\bar{X})^2\\) 1 56 19.4 376.36 2 31 -5.6 31.36 3 56 19.4 376.36 4 8 28.6 817.96 5 32 -4.6 21.16 That last column contains all of our squared deviations, so all we have to do is average them. If we do that by hand, i.e. using a calculator, we end up with a variance of 324.64. Exciting, isnt it? For the moment, lets ignore the burning question that youre all probably thinking (i.e., what the heck does a variance of 324.64 actually mean?) and instead talk a bit more about how to do the calculations in jamovi, because this will reveal something very weird. Start a new jamovi session by clicking on the main menu button (three horizontal lines in the top left corner and selecting New. Now type in the first five values from the afl.margins data set in column A (56, 31, 56, 8, 32). Change the variable type to Continuous and under Descriptives click the Variance check box, and you get the same values for variance as the one we calculated by hand 324.64). No, wait, you get a completely different answer (405.80) - see Figure 4.9. Thats just weird. Is jamovi broken? Is this a typo? Am I an idiot? Figure 4.9: A screenshot of jamovi showing the Variance for the first 5 values of the afl.margins variable As it happens, the answer is no.22 Its not a typo, and jamovi is not making a mistake. In fact, its very simple to explain what jamovi is doing here, but slightly trickier to explain why jamovi is doing it. So lets start with the what. What jamovi is doing is evaluating a slightly different formula to the one I showed you above. Instead of averaging the squared deviations, which requires you to divide by the number of data points \\(N\\), jamovi has chosen to divide by \\(N-1\\). In other words, the formula that jamovi is using is this one: \\[ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 \\] So thats the what. The real question is why jamovi is dividing by \\(N-1\\) and not by \\(N\\). After all, the variance is supposed to be the mean squared deviation, right? So shouldnt we be dividing by \\(N\\), the actual number of observations in the sample? Well, yes, we should. However, as well discuss in Chapter 8, theres a subtle distinction between describing a sample and making guesses about the population from which the sample came. Up to this point, its been a distinction without a difference. Regardless of whether youre describing a sample or drawing inferences about the population, the mean is calculated exactly the same way. Not so for the variance, or the standard deviation, or for many other measures besides. What I outlined to you initially (i.e., take the actual average, and thus divide by \\(N\\)) assumes that you literally intend to calculate the variance of the sample. Most of the time, however, youre not terribly interested in the sample in and of itself. Rather, the sample exists to tell you something about the world. If so, youre actually starting to move away from calculating a sample statistic and towards the idea of estimating a population parameter. However, Im getting ahead of myself. For now, lets just take it on faith that jamovi knows what its doing, and well revisit the question later on when we talk about estimation in Chapter 8. Okay, one last thing. This section so far has read a bit like a mystery novel. Ive shown you how to calculate the variance, described the weird \\(N-1\\) thing that jamovi does and hinted at the reason why its there, but I havent mentioned the single most important thing. How do you interpret the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why I havent given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isnt one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, its completely useless if you want to communicate with an actual human. Variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable! All the numbers have been squared and they dont mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue. For instance, according to the table I presented earlier, the margin in game 1 was 376.36 points-squared higher than the average margin. This is exactly as stupid as it sounds, and so when we calculate a variance of 324.64 were in the same situation. Ive watched a lot of footy games, and at no time has anyone ever referred to points squared. Its not a real unit of measurement, and since the variance is expressed in terms of this gibberish unit, it is totally meaningless to a human. 4.2.5 Standard deviation Okay, suppose that you like the idea of using the variance because of those nice mathematical properties that I havent talked about, but since youre a human and not a robot youd like to have a measure that is expressed in the same units as the data itself (i.e., points, not points-squared). What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious! Take the square root of the variance, known as the standard deviation, also called the root mean squared deviation, or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly. Whilst nobody has a clue what a variance of 324.68 points-squared really means, its much easier to understand a standard deviation of 18.01 points since its expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as \\(s\\), though sd and std dev. are also used at times. Because the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance, you probably wont be surprised to see that the formula is: \\[ s = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 } \\] and in jamovi there is a check box for Std. deviation right above the check box for Variance. Selecting this gives a value of 26.07 for the standard deviation. However, as you might have guessed from our discussion of the variance, what jamovi actually calculates is slightly different to the formula given above. Just like the we saw with the variance, what jamovi calculates is a version that divides by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\). For reasons that will make sense when we return to this topic in Chapter 8 Ill refer to this new quantity as \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) (read as: sigma hat), and the formula for this is: \\[ \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^2 } \\] Interpreting standard deviations is slightly more complex. Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesnt have a simple interpretation. As a consequence, most of us just rely on a simple rule of thumb. In general, you should expect 68% of the data to fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% of the data to fall within 2 standard deviation of the mean, and 99.7% of the data to fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This rule tends to work pretty well most of the time, but its not exact. Its actually calculated based on an assumption that the histogram is symmetric and bell shaped.23 As you can tell from looking at the AFL winning margins histogram in Figure 4.2, this isnt exactly true of our data! Even so, the rule is approximately correct. As it turns out, 65.3% of the AFL margins data fall within one standard deviation of the mean. This is shown visually in Figure 4.10. Figure 4.10: An illustration of the standard deviation from the AFL winning margins data. The shaded bars in the histogram show how much of the data fall within one standard deviation of the mean. In this case, 65.3% of the data set lies within this range, which is pretty consistent with the approximately 68% rule discussed in the main text. 4.2.6 Which measure to use? Weve discussed quite a few measures of spread: range, IQR, mean absolute deviation, variance and standard deviation; and hinted at their strengths and weaknesses. Heres a quick : Range. Gives you the full spread of the data. Its very vulnerable to outliers and as a consequence it isnt often used unless you have good reasons to care about the extremes in the data. Interquartile range. Tells you where the middle half of the data sits. Its pretty robust and complements the median nicely. This is used a lot. Mean absolute deviation. Tells you how far on average the observations are from the mean. Its very interpretable but has a few minor issues (not discussed here) that make it less attractive to statisticians than the standard deviation. Used sometimes, but not often. Variance. Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. Its mathematically elegant and is probably the right way to describe variation around the mean, but its completely uninterpretable because it doesnt use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool, but its buried under the hood of a very large number of statistical tools. Standard deviation. This is the square root of the variance. Its fairly elegant mathematically and its expressed in the same units as the data so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation. In short, the IQR and the standard deviation are easily the two most common measures used to report the variability of the data. But there are situations in which the others are used. Ive described all of them in this book because theres a fair chance youll run into most of these somewhere. 4.3 Skew and kurtosis There are two more descriptive statistics that you will sometimes see reported in the psychological literature: skew and kurtosis. In practice, neither one is used anywhere near as frequently as the measures of central tendency and variability that weve been talking about. Skew is pretty important, so you do see it mentioned a fair bit, but Ive actually never seen kurtosis reported in a scientific article to date. Figure 4.11: An illustration of skewness. On the left we have a negatively skewed data set (skewness \\(= -.93\\)), in the middle we have a data set with no skew (well, hardly any: skewness \\(= -.006\\)), and on the right we have a positively skewed data set (skewness \\(= .93\\)). Since its the more interesting of the two, lets start by talking about the skewness. Skewness is basically a measure of asymmetry and the easiest way to explain it is by drawing some pictures. As Figure 4.11 illustrates, if the data tend to have a lot of extreme small values (i.e., the lower tail is longer than the upper tail) and not so many extremely large values (left panel) then we say that the data are negatively skewed. On the other hand, if there are more extremely large values than extremely small ones (right panel) we say that the data are positively skewed. Thats the qualitative idea behind skewness. If there are relatively more values that are far greater than the mean, the distribution is positively skewed or right skewed, with a tail stretching to the right. Negative or left skew is the opposite. A symmetric distribution has a skewness of 0. The skewness value for a positively skewed distribution is positive, and a negative value for a negatively skewed distribution. One formula for the skewness of a data set is as follows \\[ \\mbox{skewness}(X) = \\frac{1}{N \\hat{\\sigma}^3} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^3 \\] where \\(N\\) is the number of observations, \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean, and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) is the standard deviation (the divide by \\(N-1\\) version, that is). Perhaps more helpfully, you can use jamovi to calculate skewness: its a check box in the Statistics options under Exploration - Descriptives. For the afl.margins variable, the skewness figure is 0.780. If you divide the skewness estimate by the Std. error for skewness you have an indication of how skewed the data is. Especially in small samples (N&lt;50), one rule of thumb suggests that a value of 2 or less can mean that the data is not very skewed, and a value of over 2 that there is sufficient skew in the data to possibly limit its use in some statistical analyses. Though there is no clear agreement on this interpretation. That said, this does indicate that the AFL winning margins data is somewhat skewed 0.780 / 0.183 = 4.262). The final measure that is sometimes referred to, though very rarely in practice, is the kurtosis of a data set. Put simply, kurtosis is a measure of the pointiness of a data set, as illustrated in Figure 4.12. By convention, we say that the normal curve (black lines) has zero kurtosis, so the pointiness of a data set is assessed relative to this curve. Figure 4.12: An illustration of kurtosis. On the left, we have a platykurtic data set (kurtosis = \\(-.95\\)) meaning that the data set is too flat. In the middle we have a mesokurtic data set (kurtosis is almost exactly 0) which means that the pointiness of the data is just about right. Finally, on the right, we have a leptokurtic data set (kurtosis \\(= 2.12\\)) indicating that the data set is too pointy. Note that kurtosis is measured with respect to a normal curve (black line). In this Figure, the data on the left are not pointy enough, so the kurtosis is negative and we call the data platykurtic. The data on the right are too pointy, so the kurtosis is positive and we say that the data is leptokurtic. But the data in the middle are just pointy enough, so we say that it is * mesokurtic and has kurtosis zero. This is summarised in the table below: Table 4.2: informal term technical name kurtosis value too flat platykurtic negative just pointy enough mesokurtic zero too pointy leptokurtic positive The equation for kurtosis is pretty similar in spirit to the formulas weve seen already for the variance and the skewness. Except that where the variance involved squared deviations and the skewness involved cubed deviations, the kurtosis involves raising the deviations to the fourth power:24 \\[ \\mbox{kurtosis}(X) = \\frac{1}{N \\hat\\sigma^4} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left( X_i - \\bar{X} \\right)^4 - 3 \\] I know, its not terribly interesting to me either. More to the point, jamovi has a check box for kurtosis just below the check box for skewness, and this gives a value for kurtosis of 0.101 with a standard error of 0.364. This means that the AFL winning margins data are just pointy enough. 4.4 Descriptive statistics separately for each group It is very commonly the case that you find yourself needing to look at descriptive statistics broken down by some grouping variable. This is pretty easy to do in jamovi. For instance, lets say I want to look at the descriptive statistics for some clin.trial data, broken down separately by therapy type. This is a new data set, one that youve never seen before. The data is stored in the clinicaltrial.csv file and well use it a lot in Chapter ?? (you can find a complete description of the data at the start of that chapter). Lets load it and see what weve got: Figure 4.13: A screenshot of jamovi showing the variables stored in the clinicaltrial.csv file Evidently there were three drugs: a placebo, something called anxifree and something called joyzepam, and there were 6 people administered each drug. There were 9 people treated using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 9 people who received no psychological treatment. And we can see from looking at the Descriptives of the mood.gain variable that most people did show a mood gain (mean \\(=0.88\\)), though without knowing what the scale is here its hard to say much more than that. Still, thats not too bad. Overall I feel that I learned something from that. We can also go ahead and look at some other descriptive statistics, and this time separately for each type of therapy. In jamovi, check Std. deviation, Skewness and Kurtosis in the Statistics options. At the same time, transfer the therapy variable into the Split by box, and you should get something like Figure 4.14 Figure 4.14: A screenshot of jamovi showing Descriptives split by therapy type What if you have multiple grouping variables? Suppose you want to look at the average mood gain separately for all possible combinations of drug and therapy. It is possible to do this by adding another variable, drug, into the Split by box. Easy peasy, though sometimes if you split too much there isnt enough data in each breakdown combination to make meaningful calculations. In this case jamovi tells you this by stating something like NaN or Inf.25 4.5 Standard scores Suppose my friend is putting together a new questionnaire intended to measure grumpiness. The survey has 50 questions which you can answer in a grumpy way or not. Across a big sample (hypothetically, lets imagine a million people or so!) the data are fairly normally distributed, with the mean grumpiness score being 17 out of 50 questions answered in a grumpy way, and the standard deviation is 5. In contrast, when I take the questionnaire I answer 35 out of 50 questions in a grumpy way. So, how grumpy am I? One way to think about it would be to say that I have grumpiness of 35/50, so you might say that Im 70% grumpy. But thats a bit weird, when you think about it. If my friend had phrased her questions a bit differently people might have answered them in a different way, so the overall distribution of answers could easily move up or down depending on the precise way in which the questions were asked. So, Im only 70% grumpy with respect to this set of survey questions. Even if its a very good questionnaire this isnt very a informative statement. A simpler way around this is to describe my grumpiness by comparing me to other people. Shockingly, out of my friends sample of 1,000,000 people, only 159 people were as grumpy as me (thats not at all unrealistic, frankly) suggesting that Im in the top 0.016% of people for grumpiness. This makes much more sense than trying to interpret the raw data. This idea, that we should describe my grumpiness in terms of the overall distribution of the grumpiness of humans, is the qualitative idea that standardisation attempts to get at. One way to do this is to do exactly what I just did and describe everything in terms of percentiles. However, the problem with doing this is that its lonely at the top. Suppose that my friend had only collected a sample of 1000 people (still a pretty big sample for the purposes of testing a new questionnaire, Id like to add), and this time gotten, lets say, a mean of 16 out of 50 with a standard deviation of 5. The problem is that almost certainly not a single person in that sample would be as grumpy as me. However, all is not lost. A different approach is to convert my grumpiness score into a standard score, also referred to as a \\(z\\)-score. The standard score is defined as the number of standard deviations above the mean that my grumpiness score lies. To phrase it in pseudo-maths the standard score is calculated like this: \\[ \\mbox{standard score} = \\frac{\\mbox{raw score} - \\mbox{mean}}{\\mbox{standard deviation}} \\] In actual maths, the equation for the \\(z\\)-score is \\[ z_i = \\frac{X_i - \\bar{X}}{\\hat\\sigma} \\] So, going back to the grumpiness data, we can now transform Danis raw grumpiness into a standardised grumpiness score. \\[ z = \\frac{35 - 17}{5} = 3.6 \\] To interpret this value, recall the rough heuristic that I provided in Section 4.2.5 in which I noted that 99.7% of values are expected to lie within 3 standard deviations of the mean. So the fact that my grumpiness corresponds to a \\(z\\) score of 3.6 indicates that Im very grumpy indeed. In fact this suggests that Im grumpier than 99.98% of people. Sounds about right. In addition to allowing you to interpret a raw score in relation to a larger population (and thereby allowing you to make sense of variables that lie on arbitrary scales), standard scores serve a second useful function. Standard scores can be compared to one another in situations where the raw scores cant. Suppose, for instance, my friend also had another questionnaire that measured extraversion using a 24 item questionnaire. The overall mean for this measure turns out to be 13 with standard deviation 4, and I scored a 2. As you can imagine, it doesnt make a lot of sense to try to compare my raw score of 2 on the extraversion questionnaire to my raw score of 35 on the grumpiness questionnaire. The raw scores for the two variables are about fundamentally different things, so this would be like comparing apples to oranges. What about the standard scores? Well, this is a little different. If we calculate the standard scores we get \\(z = (35-17)/5 = 3.6\\) for grumpiness and \\(z = (2-13)/4 = -2.75\\) for extraversion. These two numbers can be compared to each other.26 Im much less extraverted than most people (\\(z = -2.75\\)) and much grumpier than most people (\\(z = 3.6\\)). But the extent of my unusualness is much more extreme for grumpiness, since 3.6 is a bigger number than 2.75. Because each standardised score is a statement about where an observation falls relative to its own population, it is possible to compare standardised scores across completely different variables. 4.6 Summary Calculating some basic descriptive statistics is one of the very first things you do when analysing real data, and descriptive statistics are much simpler to understand than inferential statistics, so like every other statistics textbook Ive started with descriptives. In this chapter, we talked about the following topics: Measures of central tendency. Broadly speaking, central tendency measures tell you where the data are. Theres three measures that are typically reported in the literature: the mean, median and mode. (Section 4.1) Measures of variability. In contrast, measures of variability tell you about how spread out the data are. The key measures are: range, standard deviation, and interquartile range. (Section 4.2). Measures of skewness and kurtosis. We also looked at assymetry in a variables distribution (skew) and pointness (kurtosis). (Section 4.3) Getting group summaries of variables in jamovi. Since this book focuses on doing data analysis in jamovi, we spent a bit of time talking about how descriptive statistics are computed for different subgroups. (Section 4.4) Standard scores. The \\(z\\)-score is a slightly unusual beast. Its not quite a descriptive statistic, and not quite an inference. We talked about it in Section 4.5. Make sure you understand that section. Itll come up again later. In the next Chapter well move on to a discussion of how to draw pictures! Everyone loves a pretty picture, right? But before we do, I want to end on an important point. A traditional first course in statistics spends only a small proportion of the class on descriptive statistics, maybe one or two lectures at most. The vast majority of the lecturers time is spent on inferential statistics because thats where all the hard stuff is. That makes sense, but it hides the practical everyday importance of choosing good descriptives. With that in mind 4.6.1 Epilogue: Good descriptive statistics are descriptive! The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.  Josef Stalin, Potsdam 1945 950,000  1,200,000  Estimate of Soviet repression deaths, 1937-1938 (Ellman 2002) Stalins infamous quote about the statistical character of the deaths of millions is worth giving some thought. The clear intent of his statement is that the death of an individual touches us personally and its force cannot be denied, but that the deaths of a multitude are incomprehensible and as a consequence are mere statistics and more easily ignored. Id argue that Stalin was half right. A statistic is an abstraction, a description of events beyond our personal experience, and so hard to visualise. Few if any of us can imagine what the deaths of millions is ``really like, but we can imagine one death and this gives the lone death its feeling of immediate tragedy, a feeling that is missing from Ellmans cold statistical description. Yet it is not so simple. Without numbers, without counts, without a description of what happened, we have no chance of understanding what really happened, no opportunity even to try to summon the missing feeling. And in truth, as I write this sitting in comfort on a Saturday morning half a world and a whole lifetime away from the Gulags, when I put the Ellman estimate next to the Stalin quote a dull dread settles in my stomach and a chill settles over me. The Stalinist repression is something truly beyond my experience, but with a combination of statistical data and those recorded personal histories that have come down to us, it is not entirely beyond my comprehension. Because what Ellmans numbers tell us is this: over a two year period Stalinist repression wiped out the equivalent of every man, woman and child currently alive in the city where I live. Each one of those deaths had its own story, was its own tragedy, and only some of those are known to us now. Even so, with a few carefully chosen statistics, the scale of the atrocity starts to come into focus. Thus it is no small thing to say that the first task of the statistician and the scientist is to summarise the data, to find some collection of numbers that can convey to an audience a sense of what has happened. This is the job of descriptive statistics, but its not a job that can be told solely using the numbers. You are a data analyst, and not a statistical software package. Part of your job is to take these statistics and turn them into a description. When you analyse data it is not sufficient to list off a collection of numbers. Always remember that what youre really trying to do is communicate with a human audience. The numbers are important, but they need to be put together into a meaningful story that your audience can interpret. That means you need to think about framing. You need to think about context. And you need to think about the individual events that your statistics are summarising.

Edward Tufte27 Visualising data is one of the most important tasks facing the data analyst. Its important for two distinct but closely related reasons. Firstly, theres the matter of drawing presentation graphics, displaying your data in a clean, visually appealing fashion makes it easier for your reader to understand what youre trying to tell them. Equally important, perhaps even more important, is the fact that drawing graphs helps you to understand the data. To that end, its important to draw exploratory graphics that help you learn about the data as you go about analysing it. These points might seem pretty obvious but I cannot count the number of times Ive seen people forget them. To give a sense of the importance of this chapter, I want to start with a classic illustration of just how powerful a good graph can be. To that end, the figure below shows a redrawing of one of the most famous data visualisations of all time. This is John Snows 1854 map of cholera deaths. The map is elegant in its simplicity. In the background we have a street map which helps orient the viewer. Over the top we see a large number of small dots, each one representing the location of a cholera case. The larger symbols show the location of water pumps, labelled by name. Even the most casual inspection of the graph makes it very clear that the source of the outbreak is almost certainly the Broad Street pump. Upon viewing this graph Dr Snow arranged to have the handle removed from the pump and ended the outbreak that had killed over 500 people. Such is the power of a good data visualisation. The goals in this chapter are twofold. First, to discuss several fairly standard graphs that we use a lot when analysing and presenting data, and second to show you how to create these graphs in jamovi. The graphs themselves tend to be pretty straightforward, so in one respect this chapter is pretty simple. Where people usually struggle is learning how to produce graphs, and especially learning how to produce good graphs. Fortunately, learning how to draw graphs in jamovi is reasonably simple as long as youre not too picky about what your graph looks like. What I mean when I say this is that jamovi has a lot of very good default graphs, or plots, that most of the time produce a clean, high-quality graphic. However, on those occasions when you do want to do something non-standard, or if you need to make highly specific changes to the figure, then the graphics functionality in jamovi is not yet capable of supporting advanced work or detail editing. 5.1 Histograms Lets begin with the humble histogram. Histograms are one of the simplest and most useful ways of visualising data. They make most sense when you have an interval or ratio scale variable (e.g., the afl.margins data from Chapter 4) and what you want to do is get an overall impression of the variable. Most of you probably know how histograms work, since theyre so widely used, but for the sake of completeness Ill describe them. All you do is divide up the possible values into bins and then count the number of observations that fall within each bin. This count is referred to as the frequency or density of the bin and is displayed as a vertical bar. Ihe AFL winning margins data there are 33 games in which the winning margin was less than 10 points and it is this fact that is represented by the height of the leftmost bar that we showed earlier in Chapter 4, Figure 4.2. With these earlier graphs we used an advanced plotting package in  which, for now, is beyond the capability of jamovi. But jamovi gets us close, and drawing this histogram in jamovi is pretty straightforward. Open up the plots options under Exploration - Descriptives and click the histogram check box, as in Figure 5.1. jamovi defaults to labelling the y-axis as density and the x-axis with the variable name. The bins are selected automatically, and there is no scale, or count, information on the y-axis unlike the previous Figure 4.2. But this does not matter too much because after all what we are really interested in is our impression of the shape of the distribution: is it normally distributed or is there a skew or kurtosis? Our first impressions of these characteristics come from drawing a histogram. Figure 5.1: jamovi screen showing the histogram check box One additional feature that jamovi provides is the ability to plot a Density curve. You can do this by clicking the Density check box under the Plots options (and unchecking Histogram), and this gives us the plot shown in Figure 5.2. A density plot visualises the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period. This chart is a variation of a histogram that uses kernel smoothing to plot values, allowing for smoother distributions by smoothing out the noise. The peaks of a density plot help display where values are concentrated over the interval. An advantage density plots have over histograms is that they are better at determining the distribution shape because theyre not affected by the number of bins used (each bar used in a typical histogram). A histogram comprising of only 4 bins wouldnt produce a distinguishable enough shape of distribution as a 20-bin histogram would. However, with density plots, this isnt an issue. Figure 5.2: A density plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi Although this image would need a lot of cleaning up in order to make a good presentation graphic (i.e., one youd include in a report), it nevertheless does a pretty good job of describing the data. In fact, the big strength of a histogram or density plot is that (properly used) it does show the entire spread of the data, so you can get a pretty good sense about what it looks like. The downside to histograms is that they arent very compact. Unlike some of the other plots Ill talk about its hard to cram 20-30 histograms into a single image without overwhelming the viewer. And of course, if your data are nominal scale then histograms are useless. 5.2 Boxplots Another alternative to histograms is a boxplot, sometimes called a box and whiskers plot. Like histograms theyre most suited to interval or ratio scale data. The idea behind a boxplot is to provide a simple visual depiction of the median, the interquartile range, and the range of the data. And because they do so in a fairly compact way boxplots have become a very popular statistical graphic, especially during the exploratory stage of data analysis when youre trying to understand the data yourself. Lets have a look at how they work, again using the afl.margins data as our example. Figure 5.3: A box plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi The easiest way to describe what a boxplot looks like is just to draw one. Click on the Box plot check box and you will get the plot shown on the lower right of Figure 5.3. jamovi has drawn the most basic boxplot possible. When you look at this plot this is how you should interpret it: the thick line in the middle of the box is the median; the box itself spans the range from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile; and the whiskers go out to the most extreme data point that doesnt exceed a certain bound. By default, this value is 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR), calculated as 25th percentile - (1.5*IQR) for the lower boundary, and 75th percentile + (1.5*IQR) for the upper boundary. Any observation whose value falls outside this range is plotted as a circle or dot instead of being covered by the whiskers, and is commonly referred to as an outlier. For our AFL margins data there are two observations that fall outside this range, and these observations are plotted as dots (the upper boundary is 107, and looking over the data column in the spreadsheet there are two observations with values higher than this, 108 and 116, so these are the dots). 5.2.1 Violin plots Figure 5.4: A violin plot of the afl.margins variable plotted in jamovi, alsow showing a box plot and data points A variation to the traditional box plot is the violin plot. Violin plots are similar to box plots except that they also show the kernel probability density of the data at different values. Typically, violin plots will include a marker for the median of the data and a box indicating the interquartile range, as in standard box plots. In jamovi you can achieve this sort of functionality by checking both the Violin and the Box plot check boxes. See Figure 5.4, which also has the Data check box turned on to show the actual data points on the plot. This does tend to make the graph a bit too busy though, in my opinion. Clarity is simplicity, so in practice it might be better to just use a simple box plot. 5.2.2 Drawing multiple boxplots One last thing. What if you want to draw multiple boxplots at once? Suppose, for instance, I wanted separate boxplots showing the AFL margins not just for 2010 but for every year between 1987 and 2010. To do that the first thing well have to do is find the data. These are stored in the aflsmall2.csv file. So lets load it into jamovi and see what is in it. You will see that it is a pretty big data set. It contains 4296 games and the variables that were interested in. What we want to do is have jamovi draw boxplots for the margin variable, but plotted separately for each year. The way to do this is to move the year variable across into the Split by box, as in Figure 5.5 Figure 5.5: jamovi screen shot showing the Split by window The result is shown in Figure 5.6. This version of the box plot, split by year, gives a sense of why its sometimes useful to choose box plots instead of histograms. Its possible to get a good sense of what the data look like from year to year without getting overwhelmed with too much detail. Now imagine what would have happened if Id tried to cram 24 histograms into this space: no chance at all that the reader is going to learn anything useful. Figure 5.6: Multiple boxplots plotted in jamovi, for the margin by year variables in the aflsmall2 data set 5.2.3 Using box plots to detect outliers Figure 5.7: A boxplot showing two very suspicious outliers! Because the boxplot automatically separates out those observations that lie outside a certain range, depicting them with a dot in jamovi, people often use them as an informal method for detecting outliers: observations that are suspiciously distant from the rest of the data. Heres an example. Suppose that Id drawn the boxplot for the AFL margins data and it came up looking like Figure 5.7. Its pretty clear that something funny is going on with two of the observations. Apparently, there were two games in which the margin was over 300 points! That doesnt sound right to me. Now that Ive become suspicious its time to look a bit more closely at the data. In jamovi you can quickly find out which of these observations are suspicious and then you can go back to the raw data to see if there has been a mistake in data entry. To do this you need to set up a filter so that only those observations with values over a certain threshold are included. In our example, the threshold is over 300, so that is the filter we will create. First, click on the Filters button at the top of the jamovi window, and then type margin \\(&gt;\\) 300 into the filter field, as in Figure 5.8. Figure 5.8: the jamovi filter screen This filter creates a new column in the spreadsheet view where only those observations that pass the filter are included. One neat way to quickly identify which observations these are is to tell jamovi to produce a Frequency table (in the Exploration - Descriptives window) for the ID variable (which must be a nominal variable otherwise the Frequency table is not produced). In Figure 5.9 you can see that the ID values for the observations where the margin was over 300 are 14 and 134. These are suspicious cases, or observations, where you should go back to the original data source to find out what is going on. Figure 5.9: Frequency table for ID showing the ID numbers for the two suspicious outliers: 14 and 134 Usually you find that someone has just typed in the wrong number. Whilst this might seem like a silly example, I should stress that this kind of thing actually happens a lot. Real world data sets are often riddled with stupid errors, especially when someone had to type something into a computer at some point. In fact, theres actually a name for this phase of data analysis and in practice it can take up a huge chunk of our time: data cleaning. It involves searching for typing mistakes (typos), missing data and all sorts of other obnoxious errors in raw data files. For less extreme values, even if they are flagged in a a boxplot as outliers, the decision about whether to include outliers or exclude them in any analysis depends heavily on why you think the data look they way they do and what you want to use the data for. You really need to exercise good judgement here. If the outlier looks legitimate to you, then keep it. In any case, Ill return to the topic again in Section ??. 5.3 Bar graphs Another form of graph that you often want to plot is the bar graph. Lets use the afl.finalists data set with the afl.finalists variable that I introduced in Section 4.1.6. What I want to do is draw a bar graph that displays the number of finals that each team has played in over the time spanned by the afl.finalists data set. There are lots of teams, but I am particularly interested in just four: Brisbane, Carlton, Fremantle and Richmond. So the first step is to set up a filter so just those four teams are included in the bar graph. This is straightforward in jamovi and you can do it by using the Filters function that we used previously. Open up the Filters screen and type in the following: afl.finalists == Brisbane or afl.finalists == Carlton or afl.finalists == Fremantle or afl.finalists == Richmond28 When you have done this you will see, in the Data view, that jamovi has filtered out all values apart from those we have specified. Next, open up the Exploration - Descriptives window and click on the Bar plot check box (remember to move the afl.finalists variable across into the Variables box so that jamovi knows which variable to use). You should then get a bar graph, something like that shown in Figure 5.10. Figure 5.10: Filtering to include just four AFL teams, and drawing a bar plot in jamovi 5.4 Saving image files using jamovi Hold on, you might be thinking. Whats the good of being able to draw pretty pictures in jamovi if I cant save them and send them to friends to brag about how awesome my data is? How do I save the picture? Simple. Just right click on the plot image and save it to a file, either as eps, svg or pdf. These formats all produce nice images that you can the send to your friends, or include in your assignments or papers. 5.5 Summary Perhaps Im a simple minded person, but I love pictures. Every time I write a new scientific paper one of the first things I do is sit down and think about what the pictures will be. In my head an article is really just a sequence of pictures linked together by a story. All the rest of it is just window dressing. What Im really trying to say here is that the human visual system is a very powerful data analysis tool. Give it the right kind of information and it will supply a human reader with a massive amount of knowledge very quickly. Not for nothing do we have the saying a picture is worth a thousand words. With that in mind, I think that this is one of the most important chapters in the book. The topics covered were: Common plots. Much of the chapter was focused on standard graphs that statisticians like to produce: histograms (Section 5.1), boxplots (Section 5.2) and bar graphs (Section 5.3) Saving image files. Importantly, we also covered how to export your pictures (Section 5.4) One final thing to point out. Whilst jamovi produces some really neat default graphics, editing the plots is currently not possible. For more advanced graphics and plotting capability the packages available in  are much more powerful. One of the most popular graphics systems is provided by the ggplot2 package (see http://ggplot2.org/), which is loosely based on The grammar of graphics (Wilkinson et al. 2006). Its not for novices. You need to have a pretty good grasp of  before you can start using it, and even then it takes a while to really get the hang of it. But when youre ready its worth taking the time to teach yourself, because its a much more powerful and cleaner system.

My goal in this chapter is to talk a bit more honestly about the realities of working with data than youll see anywhere else in the book. The problem with real world data sets is that they are messy. Very often the data file that you start out with doesnt have the variables stored in the right format for the analysis you want to do. Sometimes there might be a lot of missing values in your data set. Sometimes you only want to analyse a subset of the data. Et cetera. In other words, theres a lot of data manipulation that you need to do just to get the variables in your data set into the format that you need it. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a basic introduction to these pragmatic topics. Although the chapter is motivated by the kinds of practical issues that arise when manipulating real data, Ill stick with the practice that Ive adopted through most of the book and rely on very small, toy data sets that illustrate the underlying issue. Because this chapter is essentially a collection of techniques and doesnt tell a single coherent story, it may be useful to start with a list of topics: Section 6.1. Tabulating data. Section 6.2. Using logical expressions. Section 6.3. Transforming or recoding a variable. Section 6.4. Some useful mathematical functions. Section 6.5. Extracting a subset of a data set. As you can see, the list of topics that the chapter covers is pretty broad, and theres a lot of content there. Even though this is one of the longest and hardest chapters in the book, Im really only scratching the surface of several fairly different and important topics. My advice, as usual, is to read through the chapter once and try to follow as much of it as you can. Dont worry too much if you cant grasp it all at once, especially the later sections. The rest of the book is only lightly reliant on this chapter so you can get away with just understanding the basics. However, what youll probably find is that later on youll need to flick back to this chapter in order to understand some of the concepts that I refer to here. 6.1 Tabulating and cross-tabulating data A very common task when analysing data is the construction of frequency tables, or cross-tabulation of one variable against another. These tasks can be achieved in jamovi and Ill show you how in this section. 6.1.1 Creating tables for single variables Lets start with a simple example. As the father of a small child I naturally spend a lot of time watching TV shows like In the Night Garden. In the nightgarden.csv file, Ive transcribed a short section of the dialogue. The file contains two variables of interest, speaker and utterance. Open up this data set in jamovi and take a look at the data in the spreadsheet view. You will see that the data looks something like this: speaker variable: upsy-daisy upsy-daisy upsy-daisy upsy-daisy tombliboo tombliboo makka-pakka makka-pakka makka-pakka makka-pakka utterance variable: pip pip onk onk ee oo pip pip onk onk Looking at this it becomes very clear what happened to my sanity! With these as my data, one task I might find myself needing to do is construct a frequency count of the number of words each character speaks during the show. The jamovi Descriptives screen has a check box called `Frequency tables which does just this, see Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1: Frequency table for the speaker variable The output here tells us on the first line that what were looking at is a tabulation of the speaker variable. In the Levels column it lists all the different speakers that exist in the data, and in the Counts column it tells you how many times that speaker appears in the data. In other words, its a frequency table. In jamovi, the Frequency tables check box will only produce a table for single variables. For a table of two variables, for example combining speaker and utterance so that we can see how many times each speaker said a particular utterance, we need a cross-tabulation or contingency table. In jamovi you can do this by selecting the Frequencies - Contingency Tables - Independent Samples analysis, and moving the speaker variable into the Rows box, and the utterances variable into the Columns box. You then should have a contingency table like the one shown in Figure 6.2. Figure 6.2: Contingency table for the speaker and utterances variables Dont worry about the \\(\\chi^2\\) Tests table that is produced. We are going to cover this later on in chapter 10. When interpreting the contingency table remember that these are counts, so the fact that the first row and second column of numbers corresponds to a value of 2 indicates that Makka-Pakka (row 1) says onk (column 2) twice in this data set. 6.1.2 Adding percentages to a contingency table The contingency table shown in Figure 6.2 shows a table of raw frequencies. That is, a count of the total number of cases for different combinations of levels of the specified variables. However, often you want your data to be organised in terms of percentages as well as counts. You can find the check boxes for different percentages under the Cells option in the Contingency Tables window. First, click on the Row check box and the Contingency Table in the output window will change to the one in Figure 6.3. Figure 6.3: Contingency table for the speaker and utterances variables, with row percentages Figure 6.4: Contingency table for the speaker and utterances variables, with column percentages What were looking at here is the percentage of utterances made by each character. In other words, 50% of Makka-Pakkas utterances are pip, and the other 50% are onk. Lets contrast this with the table we get when we calculate column percentages (uncheck Row and check Column in the Cells options window), see Figure 6.4. In this version, what were seeing is the percentage of characters associated with each utterance. For instance, whenever the utterance ee is made (in this data set), 100% of the time its a Tombliboo saying it. 6.2 Logical expressions in jamovi A key concept that a lot of data transformations in jamovi rely on is the idea of a logical value. A logical value is an assertion about whether something is true or false. This is implemented in jamovi in a pretty straightforward way. There are two logical values, namely TRUE and FALSE. Despite the simplicity, logical values are very useful things. Lets see how they work. 6.2.1 Assessing mathematical truths In George Orwells classic book 1984 one of the slogans used by the totalitarian Party was two plus two equals five. The idea being that the political domination of human freedom becomes complete when it is possible to subvert even the most basic of truths. Its a terrifying thought, especially when the protagonist Winston Smith finally breaks down under torture and agrees to the proposition. Man is infinitely malleable, the book says. Im pretty sure that this isnt true of humans30 and its definitely not true of jamovi. jamovi is not infinitely malleable, it has rather firm opinions on the topic of what is and isnt true, at least as regards basic mathematics. If I ask it to calculate 2 + 231, it always gives the same answer, and its not bloody 5! Of course, so far jamovi is just doing the calculations. I havent asked it to explicitly assert that \\(2+2 = 4\\) is a true statement. If I want jamovi to make an explicit judgement, I can use a command like this: 2 + 2 == 4 What Ive done here is use the equality operator, ==, to force jamovi to make a true or false judgement.32 Okay, lets see what jamovi thinks of the Party slogan, so type this into the compute new variable formula box: 2 + 2 == 5 And what do you get? It should be a whole set of false values in the spreadsheet column for your newly computed variable. Booyah! Freedom and ponies for all! Or something like that. Anyway, it was worth having a look at what happens if I try to force jamovi to believe that two plus two is five by making a statement like 2 + 2 = 5. I know that if I do this in another program, say , then it throws up an error message. But wait, if you do this in jamovi you get a whole set of false values. So what is going on? Well, it seems that jamovi is being pretty smart and realises that you are testing whether it is TRUE or FALSE that 2 + 2 = 5, regardless of whether you use the correct equality operator, ==, or the equals sign =. 6.2.2 Logical operations So now weve seen logical operations at work. But so far weve only seen the simplest possible example. You probably wont be surprised to discover that we can combine logical operations with other operations and functions in a more complicated way, like this: 3*3 + 4*4 == 5*5 or this SQRT(25) == 5 Not only that, but as Table 6.2 illustrates, there are several other logical operators that you can use corresponding to some basic mathematical concepts. Hopefully these are all pretty self-explanatory. For example, the less than operator &lt; checks to see if the number on the left is less than the number on the right. If its less, then jamovi returns an answer of TRUE, but if the two numbers are equal, or if the one on the right is larger, then jamovi returns an answer of FALSE. In contrast, the less than or equal to operator &lt;= will do exactly what it says. It returns a value of TRUE if the number of the left hand side is less than or equal to the number on the right hand side. At this point I hope its pretty obvious what the greater than operator &gt; and the greater than or equal to operator &gt;= do! Next on the list of logical operators is the not equal to operator != which, as with all the others, does what it says it does. It returns a value of TRUE when things on either side are not identical to each other. Therefore, since \\(2+2\\) isnt equal to \\(5\\), we would get true as the value for our newly computed variable. Try it and see: 2 + 2 != 5 Table 6.1: Some logical operators. Technically I should be calling these binary relational operators, but quite frankly I dont want to. Its my book so no-one can make me. operation operator example input answer less than &lt; 2 &lt; 3 TRUE less than or equal to &lt;= 2 &lt;= 2 TRUE greater than &gt; 2 &gt; 3 FALSE greater than or equal to &gt;= 2 &gt;= 2 TRUE equal to == 2 == 3 FALSE not equal to != 2 != 3 TRUE Table 6.2: Some more logical operators. operation operator example input answer not NOT NOT(1==1) FALSE or or (1==1) or (2==3) TRUE and and (1==1) and (2==3) FALSE Were not quite done yet. There are three more logical operations that are worth knowing about, listed in Table 6.2. These are the not operator !, the and operator and, and the or operator or. Like the other logical operators, their behaviour is more or less exactly what youd expect given their names. For instance, if I ask you to assess the claim that either \\(2+2 = 4\\) or \\(2+2 = 5\\) youd say that its true. Since its an either-or statement, all we need is for one of the two parts to be true. Thats what the or operator does:33 (2+2 == 4) or (2+2 == 5) On the other hand, if I ask you to assess the claim that both \\(2+2 = 4\\) and \\(2+2 = 5\\) youd say that its false. Since this is an and statement we need both parts to be true. And thats what the and operator does: (2+2 == 4) and (2+2 == 5) Finally, theres the not operator, which is simple but annoying to describe in English. If I ask you to assess my claim that it is not true that \\(2+2 = 5\\) then you would say that my claim is true, because actually my claim is that \\(2+2 = 5\\) is false. And Im right. If we write this in jamovi we use this: NOT(2+2 == 5) In other words, since 2+2 == 5 is a FALSE statement, it must be the case that NOT(2+2 == 5) is a TRUE one. Essentially, what weve really done is claim that not false is the same thing as true. Obviously, this isnt really quite right in real life. But jamovi lives in a much more black or white world. For jamovi everything is either true or false. No shades of grey are allowed. Of course, in our \\(2+2 = 5\\) example, we didnt really need to use the not operator NOT and the equals to operator == as two separate operators. We could have just used the not equals to operator != like this: 2+2 != 5 6.2.3 Applying logical operation to text I also want to briefly point out that you can apply these logical operators to text as well as to logical data. Its just that we need to be a bit more careful in understanding how jamovi interprets the different operations. In this section Ill talk about how the equal to operator == applies to text, since this is the most important one. Obviously, the not equal to operator != gives the exact opposite answers to == so Im implicitly talking about that one too, but I wont give specific commands showing the use of !=. Okay, lets see how it works. In one sense, its very simple. For instance, I can ask jamovi if the word \"cat\" is the same as the word \"dog\", like this: \"cat\" == \"dog\" Thats pretty obvious, and its good to know that even jamovi can figure that out. Similarly, jamovi does recognise that a \"cat\" is acat` \"cat\" == \"cat\" Again, thats exactly what wed expect. However, what you need to keep in mind is that jamovi is not at all tolerant when it comes to grammar and spacing. If two strings differ in any way whatsoever, jamovi will say that theyre not equal to each other, as with the following: \" cat\" == \"cat\" \"cat\" == \"CAT\" \"cat\" == \"c a t\" You can also use other logical operators too. For instance jamovi also allows you to use the &lt; and &gt; operators to determine which of two text strings comes first, alphabetically speaking. Sort of. Actually, its a bit more complicated than that, but lets start with a simple example: \"cat\" &lt; \"dog\" In jamovi, this example evaluates to true. This is because \"cat\" does does come before \"dog\" alphabetically, so jamovi judges the statement to be true. However, if we ask jamovi to tell us if \"cat\" comes before \"anteater\" then it will evaluate the expression as false. So far, so good. But text data is a bit more complicated than the dictionary suggests. What about \"cat\" and \"CAT\"? Which of these comes first? Try it and find out: \"CAT\" &lt; \"cat\" This in fact evaluates to true. In other words, jamovi assumes that uppercase letters come before lowercase ones. Fair enough. No-one is likely to be surprised by that. What you might find surprising is that jamovi assumes that all uppercase letters come before all lowercase ones. That is, while \"anteater\" &lt; \"zebra\" is a true statement, and the uppercase equivalent \"ANTEATER\" &lt; \"ZEBRA\" is also true, it is not true to say that \"anteater\" &lt; \"ZEBRA\", as the following extract illustrates. Try this: \"anteater\" &lt; \"ZEBRA\" This evaluates to false, and this may seem slightly counterintuitive. With that in mind, it may help to have a quick look at Table 6.3 which lists various text characters in the order that jamovi processes them. Table 6.3: The ordering of various text characters used by the &lt; and &gt; operators, as well as by the sort() function. Not shown is the space character, which actually comes &lt;U+FB01&gt;rst on the list. Characters ! \" # $ % &amp;  ( ) * + , - . / 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z [ ] ^ _  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z } | { 6.3 Transforming and recoding a variable Its not uncommon in real world data analysis to find that one of your variables isnt quite equivalent to the variable that you really want. For instance, its often convenient to take a continuous-valued variable (e.g., age) and break it up into a smallish number of categories (e.g., younger, middle, older). At other times, you may need to convert a numeric variable into a different numeric variable (e.g., you may want to analyse at the absolute value of the original variable). In this section Ill describe a few key ways you can do these things in jamovi. 6.3.1 Creating a transformed variable The first trick to discuss is the idea of transforming a variable. Taken literally, anything you do to a variable is a transformation, but in practice what it usually means is that you apply a relatively simple mathematical function to the original variable in order to create a new variable that either (a) provides a better way of describing the thing youre actually interested in, or (b) is more closely in agreement with the assumptions of the statistical tests you want to do. Since, at this stage, I havent talked about statistical tests or their assumptions, Ill show you an example based on the first case. Suppose Ive run a short study in which I ask 10 people a single question: On a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), to what extent do you agree with the proposition that Dinosaurs are awesome? Now lets load and look at the data. The data file likert.omv contains a single variable that contains raw Likert-scale responses for these 10 people. However, if you think about it, this isnt the best way to represent these responses. Because of the fairly symmetric way that we set up the response scale, theres a sense in which the midpoint of the scale should have been coded as 0 (no opinion), and the two endpoints should be \\(+3\\) (strongly agree) and \\(-3\\) (strongly disagree). By recoding the data in this way its a bit more reflective of how we really think about the responses. The recoding here is pretty straightforward, we just subtract 4 from the raw scores. In jamovi you can do this by computing a new variable: click on the Data - Compute button and you will see that a new variable has been added to the spreadsheet. Lets call this new variable likert.centred (go ahead and type that in) and then add the following in the formula box, like in Figure 6.5: likert.raw - 4 Figure 6.5: Creating a new computed variable in jamovi One reason why it might be useful to have the data in this format is that there are a lot of situations where you might prefer to analyse the strength of the opinion separately from the direction of the opinion. We can do two different transformations on this likert.centred variable in order to distinguish between these two different concepts. First, to compute an opinion.strength variable, we want to take the absolute value of the centred data (using the ABS function).34 In jamovi, create another new variable using the Compute button. Name the variable opinion.strength and this time click on the fx button next to the Formula box. This shows the different Functions and Variables that you can add to the Formula box, so double click on ABS and then double click on likert.centred and you will see that the `Formula box is populated with ABS(likert.centred) and a new variable has been created in the spreadsheet view, as in Figure 6.6 Figure 6.6: Using the fx button to select functions and variables Second, to compute a variable that contains only the direction of the opinion and ignores the strength, we want to calculate the sign of the variable. In jamovi we can use the IF function to do this. Create another new variable using the Compute button, name this one opinion.sign, and then type the following into the function box: IF(likert.centred == 0, 0, likert.centred / opinion.strength) When done, youll see that all negative numbers from the likert.centred variable are converted to \\(-1\\), all positive numbers are converted to \\(1\\) and zero stays as \\(0\\), like so: -1 1 -1 0 0 0 -1 1 1 1 Lets break down what this IF command is doing. In jamovi there are three parts to an IF statement, written as IF(expression, value, else). The first part, expression can be a logical or mathematical statement. In our example, we have specified likert.centred == 0, which is TRUE for values where likert.centred is zero. The next part, value, is the new value where the expression in part one is TRUE. In our example, we have said that for all those values where likert.centred is zero, keep them zero. In the next part, else, we can enter another logical or mathematical statement to be used if part one evaluates to FALSE, i.e. where likert.centred is not zero. In our example we have divided likert.centred by opinion.strength to give -1 or +1 depending of the sign of the original value in likert.centred.35 And were done. We now have three shiny new variables, all of which are useful transformations of the original likert.raw data. 6.3.2 Collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories One pragmatic task that comes up quite often is the problem of collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels or categories. For instance, suppose Im interested in looking at the age distribution of people at a social gathering: 60,58,24,26,34,42,31,30,33,2,9 In some situations it can be quite helpful to group these into a smallish number of categories. For example, we could group the data into three broad categories: young (0-20), adult (21-40) and older (41-60). This is a quite coarse-grained classification, and the labels that Ive attached only make sense in the context of this data set (e.g., viewed more generally, a 42 year old wouldnt consider themselves as older). We can slice this variable up quite easily using the jamovi IF function that we have already used. This time we have to specify nested IF statements, meaning simply that IF the first logical expression is TRUE, insert a first value, but IF a second logical expression is TRUE, insert a second value, but IF a third logical expression is TRUE, then insert a third value. This can be written as: IF(Age &gt;= 0 and Age &lt;= 20, 1, IF(Age &gt;= 21 and Age &lt;= 40, 2, IF(Age &gt;= 41 and Age &lt;= 60, 3 ))) Note that there are three left parentheses used during the nesting, so the whole statement has to end with three right parentheses otherwise you will get an error message. The jamovi screen shot for this data manipulation, along with an accompanying frequency table, is shown in Figure 6.7 Figure 6.7: Collapsing a variable into a smaller number of discrete levels using the jamovi IF function Its important to take the time to figure out whether or not the resulting categories make any sense at all in terms of your research project. If they dont make any sense to you as meaningful categories, then any data analysis that uses those categories is likely to be just as meaningless. More generally, in practice Ive noticed that people have a very strong desire to carve their (continuous and messy) data into a few (discrete and simple) categories, and then run analyses using the categorised data instead of the original data.36 I wouldnt go so far as to say that this is an inherently bad idea, but it does have some fairly serious drawbacks at times, so I would advise some caution if you are thinking about doing it. 6.3.3 Creating a transformation that can be applied to multiple variables Figure 6.8: Creating a new variable transformation using the jamovi `Transform command Sometimes you want to apply the same transformation to more than one variable, for example when you have multiple questionnaire items that all need to be recalculated or recoded in the same way. And one of the neat features in jamovi is that you can create a transformation, using the Data - Transform button, that can then be saved and applied to multiple variables. Lets go back to the first example above, using the data file likert.omv that contains a single variable with raw Likert-scale responses for 10 people. To create a transformation that you can save and then apply across multiple variables (assuming you had more variables like this in your data file), first in the spreadsheet editor select (i.e., click) the variable you want to use to initially create the transformation. In our example this is likert.raw. Next click the Transform button in the jamovi Data ribbon, and youll see something like Figure 6.8. Figure 6.9: Specifying a transformation in jamovi, to be saved as the imaginatively named Transform 1 Give your new variable a name, lets call it opinion.strength and then click on the using transform selection box and select Create New Transform. This is where you will create, and name, the transformation that can be re-applied to as many variables as you like. The transformation is automatically named for us as Transform 1 (imaginative, huh. You can change this if you like). Then type the expression ABS(\\$source - 4) into the function text box, as in Figure 6.9, press Enter or Return on your keyboard and, hey presto, you have created a new transformation and applied it to the likert.raw variable! Good, eh. Note that instead of using the variable label in the expression, we have instead used \\$source. This is so that we can then use the same transformation with as many different variables as we like - jamovi requires you to use \\$source to refer to the source variable you are transforming. Your transformation has also been saved and can be re-used any time you like (providing you save the dataset as an .omv file, otherwise youll lose it!). You can also create a transformation with the second example we looked at, the age distribution of people at a social gathering. Go on, you know you want to! Remember that we collapsed this variable into three groups: younger, adult and older. This time we will achieve the same thing, but using the jamovi Transform - Add condition button. With this data set (go back to it or create it again if you didnt save it) set up a new variable transformation. Call the transformed variable AgeCats and the transformation you will create Agegroupings. Then click on the big + sign next to the function box. This is the Add condition button and Ive stuck a big red arrow onto Figure 6.10 so you can see exactly where this is. Re-create the transformation shown in Figure 6.10 and when you have done, you will see the new values appear in the spreadsheet window. Whats more, the Agegroupings transformation has been saved and can be re-applied any time you like. Ok, so I know that its unlikely you will have more than one Age variable, but you get the idea now of how to set up transformations in jamovi, so you can follow this idea with other sorts of variables. A typical scenario for this is when you have a questionnaire scale with, say, 20 items (variables) and each item was originally scored from 1 to 6 but, for some reason or quirk of the data you decide to recode all the items as 1 to 3. You can easily do this in jamovi by creating and then re-applying your transformation for each variable that you want to recode. Figure 6.10: jamovi transformation into three age categories, using the Add condition button 6.4 A few more mathematical functions and operations In Section 6.3 I discussed the ideas behind variable transformations and showed that a lot of the transformations that you might want to apply to your data are based on fairly simple mathematical functions and operations. In this section I want to return to that discussion and mention several other mathematical functions and arithmetic operations that are actually quite useful for a lot of real world data analysis. Table 6.4 gives a brief overview of the various mathematical functions I want to talk about here, or later.37 Obviously this doesnt even come close to cataloguing the range of possibilities available, but it does cover a range of functions that are used regularly in data analysis and that are available in jamovi. Table 6.4: Some of the mathematical functions available in jamovi mathematical.function R.function example.input answer square root SQRT(x) SQRT(25) 5 absolute value ABS(x) ABS(-23) 23 logarithm (base 10) LOG10(x) LOG10(1000) 3 logarithm (base e) LN(x) LN(1000) 6.908 exponentiation EXP(x) EXP(6.908) 1000.245 box-cox BOXCOX(x, lamda) BOXCOX(6.908, 3) 109.551 6.4.1 Logarithms and exponentials As Ive mentioned earlier, jamovi has an useful range of mathematical functions built into it and there really wouldnt be much point in trying to describe or even list all of them. For the most part, Ive focused only on those functions that are strictly necessary for this book. However I do want to make an exception for logarithms and exponentials. Although they arent needed anywhere else in this book, they are everywhere in statistics more broadly. And not only that, there are a *lot} of situations in which it is convenient to analyse the logarithm of a variable (i.e., to take a log-transform of the variable). I suspect that many (maybe most) readers of this book will have encountered logarithms and exponentials before, but from past experience I know that theres a substantial proportion of students who take a social science statistics class who havent touched logarithms since high school, and would appreciate a bit of a refresher. In order to understand logarithms and exponentials, the easiest thing to do is to actually calculate them and see how they relate to other simple calculations. There are three jamovi functions in particular that I want to talk about, namely LN(), LOG10() and EXP(). To start with, lets consider LOG10(), which is known as the llogarithm in base 10. The trick to understanding a logarithm is to understand that its basically the opposite of taking a power. Specifically, the logarithm in base 10 is closely related to the powers of 10. So lets start by noting that 10-cubed is 1000. Mathematically, we would write this: \\[ 10^3 = 1000 \\] The trick to understanding a logarithm is to recognise that the statement that 10 to the power of 3 is equal to 1000 is equivalent to the statement that the logarithm (in base 10) of 1000 is equal to 3. Mathematically, we write this as follows, \\[ \\log_{10}( 1000 ) = 3 \\] Okay, since the LOG10() function is related to the powers of 10, you might expect that there are other logarithms (in bases other than 10) that are related to other powers too. And of course thats true: theres not really anything mathematically special about the number 10. You and I happen to find it useful because decimal numbers are built around the number 10, but the big bad world of mathematics scoffs at our decimal numbers. Sadly, the universe doesnt actually care how we write down numbers. Anyway, the consequence of this cosmic indifference is that theres nothing particularly special about calculating logarithms in base 10. You could, for instance, calculate your logarithms in base 2. Alternatively, a third type of logarithm, and one we see a lot more of in statistics than either base 10 or base 2, is called the natural logarithm, and corresponds to the logarithm in base \\(e\\). Since you might one day run into it, Id better explain what \\(e\\) is. The number \\(e\\), known as Eulers number, is one of those annoying irrational numbers whose decimal expansion is infinitely long, and is considered one of the most important numbers in mathematics. The first few digits of \\(e\\) are: \\[ e = 2.718282 \\] There are quite a few situation in statistics that require us to calculate powers of \\(e\\), though none of them appear in this book. Raising \\(e\\) to the power \\(x\\) is called the exponential of \\(x\\), and so its very common to see \\(e^x\\) written as \\(\\exp(x)\\). And so its no surprise that jamovi has a function that calculates exponentials, called EXP(). Because the number \\(e\\) crops up so often in statistics, the natural logarithm (i.e., logarithm in base \\(e\\)) also tends to turn up. Mathematicians often write it as \\(\\log_e(x)\\) or \\(\\ln(x)\\). In fact, jamovi works the same way: the LN() function corresponds to the natural logarithm. And with that, I think weve had quite enough exponentials and logarithms for this book! 6.5 Extracting a subset of the data One very important kind of data handling is being able to extract a particular subset of the data. For instance, you might be interested only in analysing the data from one experimental condition, or you may want to look closely at the data from people over 50 years in age. To do this, the first step is getting jamovi to filter the subset of the data corresponding to the observations that youre interested in. This section returns to the nightgarden.csv data set. If youre reading this whole chapter in one sitting, then you should already have this data set loaded into a jamovi window. For this section, lets focus on the two variables speaker and utterance (see Section 6.1 if youve forgotten what those variables look like). Suppose that what I want to do is pull out only those utterances that were made by Makka-Pakka. To that end, we need to specify a filter in jamovi. First open up a filter window by clicking on Filters on the main jamovi Data toolbar. Then, in the Filter 1 text box, next to the = sign, type the following: speaker == 'makka-pakka' Figure 6.11: Creating a subset of the nightgarden data using the jamovi Filters option When you have done this, you will see that a new column has been added to the spreadsheet window (see Figure 6.11), labelled Filter 1, with the cases where speaker is not makka-pakka greyed-out (i.e., filtered out) and, conversely, the cases where speaker is makka-pakka have a green check mark indicating they are filtered in. You can test this by running Exploration - Descriptives - Frequency tables' for thespeaker` variable and seeing what that shows. Go on, try it! Following on from this simple example, you can also build up more complex filters using logical expressions in jamovi. For instance, suppose I wanted to keep only those cases when the utterance is either pip or oo. In this case in the Filter 1 text box, next to the = sign, you would type the following: utterance == 'pip' or utterance == 'oo' 6.6 Summary Obviously, theres no real coherence to this chapter. Its just a grab bag of topics and tricks that can be handy to know about, so the best wrap up I can give here is just to repeat this list: Section 6.1. Tabulating data. Section 6.2. Using logical expressions. Section 6.3. Transforming or recoding a variable. Section 6.4. Some useful mathematical functions. Section 6.5. Extracting a subset of a data set. The quote comes from Home is the Hangman, published in 1975. I offer up my teenage attempts to be cool as evidence that some things just cant be done. You can do this in the Compute new variable screen, though just calculating 2 + 2 for every cell of a new variable is not very useful! Note that this is a very different operator to the equals operator =. A common typo that people make when trying to write logical commands in jamovi (or other languages, since the = versus == distinction is important in many computer and statistical programs) is to accidentally type = when you really mean ==. Be especially cautious with this, Ive been programming in various languages since I was a teenager and I still screw this up a lot. Hmm. I think I see why I wasnt cool as a teenager. And why Im still not cool. Now, heres a quirk in jamovi. When you have simple logical expressions like the ones we have already met, e.g. 2 + 2 == 5 then jamovi neatly states false (or true) in the corresponding spreadsheet column. Underneath the hood, jamovi stores false as 0 and true as 1. When we have more complex logical expressions, such as (2+2 == 4) or (2+2 == 5), then jamovi just displays either 0 or 1, depending whether the logical expression is evaluated as false, or true.  The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of whether its sign is negative or positive. The reason we have to use the IF command and keep zero as zero is that you cannot just use likert.centred / opinion.strength to calculate the sign of likert.centred, because mathematically dividing zero by zero does not work. Try it and see If youve read further into the book, and are re-reading this section, then a good example of this would be someone choosing to do an ANOVA using AgeCats as the grouping variable, instead of running a regression using Age as a predictor. There are sometimes good reasons for doing this. For instance, if the relationship between Age and your outcome variable is highly non-linear and you arent comfortable with trying to run non-linear regression! However, unless you really do have a good rationale for doing this, its best not to. It tends to introduce all sorts of other problems (e.g., the data will probably violate the normality assumption) and you can lose a lot of statistical power.

John Locke Up to this point in the book weve discussed some of the key ideas in experimental design, and weve talked a little about how you can summarise a data set. To a lot of people this is all there is to statistics: collecting all the numbers, calculating averages, drawing pictures, and putting them all in a report somewhere. Kind of like stamp collecting but with numbers. However, statistics covers much more than that. In fact, descriptive statistics is one of the smallest parts of statistics and one of the least powerful. The bigger and more useful part of statistics is that it provides information that lets you make inferences about data. Once you start thinking about statistics in these terms, that statistics is there to help us draw inferences from data, you start seeing examples of it everywhere. For instance, heres a tiny extract from a newspaper article in the Sydney Morning Herald (30 Oct 2010): I have a tough job, the Premier said in response to a poll which found her government is now the most unpopular Labor administration in polling history, with a primary vote of just 23 per cent. This kind of remark is entirely unremarkable in the papers or in everyday life, but lets have a think about what it entails. A polling company has conducted a survey, usually a pretty big one because they can afford it. Im too lazy to track down the original survey so lets just imagine that they called 1000 New South Wales (NSW) voters at random, and 230 (23%) of those claimed that they intended to vote for the Australian Labor Party (ALP). For the 2010 Federal election the Australian Electoral Commission reported 4,610,795 enrolled voters in NSW, so the opinions of the remaining 4,609,795 voters (about 99.98% of voters) remain unknown to us. Even assuming that no-one lied to the polling company the only thing we can say with 100% confidence is that the true ALP primary vote is somewhere between 230/4610795 (about 0.005%) and 4610025/4610795 (about 99.83%). So, on what basis is it legitimate for the polling company, the newspaper, and the readership to conclude that the ALP primary vote is only about 23%? The answer to the question is pretty obvious. If I call 1000 people at random, and 230 of them say they intend to vote for the ALP, then it seems very unlikely that these are the only 230 people out of the entire voting public who actually intend to vote ALP. In other words, we assume that the data collected by the polling company is pretty representative of the population at large. But how representative? Would we be surprised to discover that the true ALP primary vote is actually 24%? 29%? 37%? At this point everyday intuition starts to break down a bit. No-one would be surprised by 24%, and everybody would be surprised by 37%, but its a bit hard to say whether 29% is plausible. We need some more powerful tools than just looking at the numbers and guessing. Inferential statistics provides the tools that we need to answer these sorts of questions, and since these kinds of questions lie at the heart of the scientific enterprise, they take up the lions share of every introductory course on statistics and research methods. However, the theory of statistical inference is built on top of probability theory. And it is to probability theory that we must now turn. This discussion of probability theory is basically background detail. Theres not a lot of statistics per se in this chapter, and you dont need to understand this material in as much depth as the other chapters in this part of the book. Nevertheless, because probability theory does underpin so much of statistics, its worth covering some of the basics. 7.1 How are probability and statistics different? Before we start talking about probability theory, its helpful to spend a moment thinking about the relationship between probability and statistics. The two disciplines are closely related but theyre not identical. Probability theory is the doctrine of chances. Its a branch of mathematics that tells you how often different kinds of events will happen. For example, all of these questions are things you can answer using probability theory: What are the chances of a fair coin coming up heads 10 times in a row? If I roll a six sided dice twice, how likely is it that Ill roll two sixes? How likely is it that five cards drawn from a perfectly shuffled deck will all be hearts? What are the chances that Ill win the lottery? Notice that all of these questions have something in common. In each case the truth of the world is known and my question relates to the what kind of events will happen. In the first question I know that the coin is fair so theres a 50% chance that any individual coin flip will come up heads. In the second question I know that the chance of rolling a 6 on a single die is 1 in 6. In the third question I know that the deck is shuffled properly. And in the fourth question I know that the lottery follows specific rules. You get the idea. The critical point is that probabilistic questions start with a known model of the world, and we use that model to do some calculations. The underlying model can be quite simple. For instance, in the coin flipping example we can write down the model like this: \\[ P(\\mbox{heads}) = 0.5 \\] which you can read as the probability of heads is 0.5. As well see later, in the same way that percentages are numbers that range from 0% to 100%, probabilities are just numbers that range from 0 to 1. When using this probability model to answer the first question I dont actually know exactly whats going to happen. Maybe Ill get 10 heads, like the question says. But maybe Ill get three heads. Thats the key thing. In probability theory the model is known but the data are not. So thats probability. What about statistics? Statistical questions work the other way around. In statistics we do not know the truth about the world. All we have is the data and it is from the data that we want to learn the truth about the world. Statistical questions tend to look more like these: If my friend flips a coin 10 times and gets 10 heads are they playing a trick on me? If five cards off the top of the deck are all hearts how likely is it that the deck was shuffled? If the lottery commissioners spouse wins the lottery how likely is it that the lottery was rigged? This time around the only thing we have are data. What I know is that I saw my friend flip the coin 10 times and it came up heads every time. And what I want to infer is whether or not I should conclude that what I just saw was actually a fair coin being flipped 10 times in a row, or whether I should suspect that my friend is playing a trick on me. The data I have look like this: H H H H H H H H H H H and what Im trying to do is work out which model of the world I should put my trust in. If the coin is fair then the model I should adopt is one that says that the probability of heads is 0.5, that is \\(P(\\mbox{heads}) = 0.5\\). If the coin is not fair then I should conclude that the probability of heads is not 0.5, which we would write as \\(P(\\mbox{heads}) \\neq 0.5\\). In other words, the statistical inference problem is to figure out which of these probability models is right. Clearly, the statistical question isnt the same as the probability question, but theyre deeply connected to one another. Because of this, a good introduction to statistical theory will start with a discussion of what probability is and how it works. 7.2 What does probability mean? Lets start with the first of these questions. What is probability? It might seem surprising to you but while statisticians and mathematicians (mostly) agree on what the rules of probability are, theres much less of a consensus on what the word really means. It seems weird because were all very comfortable using words like chance, likely, possible and probable, and it doesnt seem like it should be a very difficult question to answer. But if youve ever had that experience in real life you might walk away from the conversation feeling like you didnt quite get it right, and that (like many everyday concepts) it turns out that you dont really know what its all about. So Ill have a go at it. Lets suppose I want to bet on a soccer game between two teams of robots, Arduino Arsenal and C Milan. After thinking about it, I decide that there is an 80% probability of Arduino Arsenal winning. What do I mean by Theyre robot teams so I can make them play over and over again, and if I did that Arduino Arsenal would win 8 out of every 10 games on average. For any given game, I would agree that betting on this game is only fair if a $1 bet on C Milan gives a $5 payoff (i.e. I get my $1 back plus a $4 reward for being correct), as would a $4 bet on Arduino Arsenal (i.e., my $4 bet plus a $1 reward). My subjective belief or confidence in an Arduino Arsenal victory is four times as strong as my belief in a C Milan victory. Each of these seems sensible. However, theyre not identical and not every statistician would endorse all of them. The reason is that there are different statistical ideologies (yes, really!) and depending on which one you subscribe to, you might say that some of those statements are meaningless or irrelevant. In this section I give a brief introduction the two main approaches that exist in the literature. These are by no means the only approaches, but theyre the two big ones. 7.2.1 The frequentist view The first of the two major approaches to probability, and the more dominant one in statistics, is referred to as the frequentist view and it defines probability as a long-run frequency. Suppose we were to try flipping a fair coin over and over again. By definition this is a coin that has \\(P(H) = 0.5\\). What might we observe? One possibility is that the first 20 flips might look like this: T,H,H,H,H,T,T,H,H,H,H,T,H,H,T,T,T,T,T,H In this case 11 of these 20 coin flips (55%) came up heads. Now suppose that Id been keeping a running tally of the number of heads (which Ill call \\(N_H\\)) that Ive seen, across the first \\(N\\) flips, and calculate the proportion of heads \\(N_H / N\\) every time. Heres what Id get (I did literally flip coins to produce this!): Number of flips Number of heads Proportion 1 0 0.00 2 1 0.50 3 2 0.67 4 3 0.75 5 4 0.80 6 4 0.67 7 4 0.57 8 5 0.63 9 6 0.67 10 7 0.70 11 8 0.73 12 8 0.67 13 9 0.69 14 10 0.71 15 10 0.67 16 10 0.63 17 10 0.59 18 10 0.56 19 10 0.53 20 11 0.55 Notice that at the start of the sequence the proportion of heads fluctuates wildly, starting at .00 and rising as high as .80. Later on, one gets the impression that it dampens out a bit, with more and more of the values actually being pretty close to the right answer of .50. This is the frequentist definition of probability in a nutshell. Flip a fair coin over and over again, and as \\(N\\) grows large (approaches infinity, denoted \\(N\\rightarrow \\infty\\)) the proportion of heads will converge to 50%. There are some subtle technicalities that the mathematicians care about, but qualitatively speaking thats how the frequentists define probability. Unfortunately, I dont have an infinite number of coins or the infinite patience required to flip a coin an infinite number of times. However, I do have a computer and computers excel at mindless repetitive tasks. So I asked my computer to simulate flipping a coin 1000 times and then drew a picture of what happens to the proportion \\(N_H / N\\) as \\(N\\) increases. Actually, I did it four times just to make sure it wasnt a fluke. The results are shown in Figure 7.1. As you can see, the proportion of observed heads eventually stops fluctuating and settles down. When it does, the number at which it finally settles is the true probability of heads. Figure 7.1: An illustration of how frequentist probability works. If you flip a fair coin over and over again, the proportion of heads that youve seen eventually settles down, and converges to the true probability of 0.5. Each panel shows four different simulated experiments: in each case, we pretend we flipped a coin 1000 times, and kept track of the proportion of flips that were heads as we went along. Although none of these sequences actually ended up with an exact value of .5, if wed extended the experiment for an infinite number of coin flips they would have. The frequentist definition of probability has some desirable characteristics. First, it is objective. The probability of an event is necessarily grounded in the world. The only way that probability statements can make sense is if they refer to (a sequence of) events that occur in the physical universe.38 Secondly, it is unambiguous. Any two people watching the same sequence of events unfold, trying to calculate the probability of an event, must inevitably come up with the same answer. However, it also has undesirable characteristics. First, infinite sequences dont exist in the physical world. Suppose you picked up a coin from your pocket and started to flip it. Every time it lands it impacts on the ground. Each impact wears the coin down a bit. Eventually the coin will be destroyed. So, one might ask whether it really makes sense to pretend that an infinite sequence of coin flips is even a meaningful concept, or an objective one. We cant say that an infinite sequence of events is a real thing in the physical universe, because the physical universe doesnt allow infinite anything. More seriously, the frequentist definition has a narrow scope. There are lots of things out there that human beings are happy to assign probability to in everyday language, but cannot (even in theory) be mapped onto a hypothetical sequence of events. For instance, if a meteorologist comes on TV and says the probability of rain in Adelaide on 2 November 2048 is 60% we humans are happy to accept this. But its not clear how to define this in frequentist terms. Theres only one city of Adelaide, and only one 2 November 2048. Theres no infinite sequence of events here, just a one-off thing. Frequentist probability genuinely forbids us from making probability statements about a single event. From the frequentist perspective it will either rain tomorrow or it will not. There is no probability that attaches to a single non-repeatable event. Now, it should be said that there are some very clever tricks that frequentists can use to get around this. One possibility is that what the meteorologist means is something like There is a category of days for which I predict a 60% chance of rain, and if we look only across those days for which I make this prediction, then on 60% of those days it will actually rain. Its very weird and counterintuitive to think of it this way, but you do see frequentists do this sometimes. And it will come up later in this book (see Section 8.5). 7.2.2 The Bayesian view The Bayesian view of probability is often called the subjectivist view, and although it has been a minority view among statisticians it has been steadily gaining traction for the last several decades. There are many flavours of Bayesianism, making it hard to say exactly what the Bayesian view is. The most common way of thinking about subjective probability is to define the probability of an event as the degree of belief that an intelligent and rational agent assigns to that truth of that event. From that perspective, probabilities dont exist in the world but rather in the thoughts and assumptions of people and other intelligent beings. However, in order for this approach to work we need some way of operationalising degree of belief. One way that you can do this is to formalise it in terms of rational gambling, though there are many other ways. Suppose that I believe that theres a 60% probability of rain tomorrow. If someone offers me a bet that if it rains tomorrow then I win $5, but if it doesnt rain I lose $5. Clearly, from my perspective, this is a pretty good bet. On the other hand, if I think that the probability of rain is only 40% then its a bad bet to take. So we can operationalise the notion of a subjective probability in terms of what bets Im willing to accept. What are the advantages and disadvantages to the Bayesian approach? The main advantage is that it allows you to assign probabilities to any event you want to. You dont need to be limited to those events that are repeatable. The main disadvantage (to many people) is that we cant be purely objective. Specifying a probability requires us to specify an entity that has the relevant degree of belief. This entity might be a human, an alien, a robot, or even a statistician. But there has to be an intelligent agent out there that believes in things. To many people this is uncomfortable, it seems to make probability arbitrary. Whilst the Bayesian approach requires that the agent in question be rational (i.e., obey the rules of probability), it does allow everyone to have their own beliefs. I can believe the coin is fair and you dont have to, even though were both rational. The frequentist view doesnt allow any two observers to attribute different probabilities to the same event. When that happens then at least one of them must be wrong. The Bayesian view does not prevent this from occurring. Two observers with different background knowledge can legitimately hold different beliefs about the same event. In short, where the frequentist view is sometimes considered to be too narrow (forbids lots of things that that we want to assign probabilities to), the Bayesian view is sometimes thought to be too broad (allows too many differences between observers). 7.2.3 Whats the difference? And who is right? Now that youve seen each of these two views independently its useful to make sure you can compare the two. Go back to the hypothetical robot soccer game at the start of the section. What do you think a frequentist and a Bayesian would say about these three statements? Which statement would a frequentist say is the correct definition of probability? Which one would a Bayesian opt for? Would some of these statements be meaningless to a frequentist or a Bayesian? If youve understood the two perspectives you should have some sense of how to answer those questions. Okay, assuming you understand the difference then you might be wondering which of them is right? Honestly, I dont know that there is a right answer. As far as I can tell theres nothing mathematically incorrect about the way frequentists think about sequences of events, and theres nothing mathematically incorrect about the way that Bayesians define the beliefs of a rational agent. In fact, when you dig down into the details Bayesians and frequentists actually agree about a lot of things. Many frequentist methods lead to decisions that Bayesians agree a rational agent would make. Many Bayesian methods have very good frequentist properties. For the most part, Im a pragmatist so Ill use any statistical method that I trust. As it turns out, that makes me prefer Bayesian methods for reasons Ill explain towards the end of the book. But Im not fundamentally opposed to frequentist methods. Not everyone is quite so relaxed. For instance, consider Sir Ronald Fisher, one of the towering figures of 20th century statistics and a vehement opponent to all things Bayesian, whose paper on the mathematical foundations of statistics referred to Bayesian probability as an impenetrable jungle [that] arrests progress towards precision of statistical concepts (Fisher 1922b, 311). Or the psychologist Paul Meehl, who suggests that relying on frequentist methods could turn you into a potent but sterile intellectual rake who leaves in his merry path a long train of ravished maidens but no viable scientific offspring (Meehl 1967, 114). The history of statistics, as you might gather, is not devoid of entertainment. In any case, whilst I personally prefer the Bayesian view, the majority of statistical analyses are based on the frequentist approach. My reasoning is pragmatic. The goal of this book is to cover roughly the same territory as a typical undergraduate stats class in psychology, and if you want to understand the statistical tools used by most psychologists youll need a good grasp of frequentist methods. I promise you that this isnt wasted effort. Even if you end up wanting to switch to the Bayesian perspective, you really should read through at least one book on the orthodox frequentist view. Besides, I wont completely ignore the Bayesian perspective. Every now and then Ill add some commentary from a Bayesian point of view, and Ill revisit the topic in more depth in Chapter ??. 7.3 Basic probability theory Ideological arguments between Bayesians and frequentists notwithstanding, it turns out that people mostly agree on the rules that probabilities should obey. There are lots of different ways of arriving at these rules. The most commonly used approach is based on the work of Andrey Kolmogorov, one of the great Soviet mathematicians of the 20th century. I wont go into a lot of detail, but Ill try to give you a bit of a sense of how it works. And in order to do so Im going to have to talk about my trousers. 7.3.1 Introducing probability distributions One of the disturbing truths about my life is that I only own 5 pairs of trousers. Three pairs of jeans, the bottom half of a suit, and a pair of tracksuit pants. Even sadder, Ive given them names: I call them \\(X_1\\), \\(X_2\\), \\(X_3\\), \\(X_4\\) and \\(X_5\\). I really have, thats why they call me Mister Imaginative. Now, on any given day, I pick out exactly one of pair of trousers to wear. Not even Im so stupid as to try to wear two pairs of trousers, and thanks to years of training I never go outside without wearing trousers anymore. If I were to describe this situation using the language of probability theory, I would refer to each pair of trousers (i.e., each \\(X\\)) as an elementary event. The key characteristic of elementary events is that every time we make an observation (e.g., every time I put on a pair of trousers) then the outcome will be one and only one of these events. Like I said, these days I always wear exactly one pair of trousers so my trousers satisfy this constraint. Similarly, the set of all possible events is called a sample space. Granted, some people would call it a wardrobe, but thats because theyre refusing to think about my trousers in probabilistic terms. Sad. Okay, now that we have a sample space (a wardrobe), which is built from lots of possible elementary events (trousers), what we want to do is assign a probability of one of these elementary events. For an event \\(X\\), the probability of that event \\(P(X)\\) is a number that lies between 0 and 1. The bigger the value of \\(P(X)\\), the more likely the event is to occur. So, for example, if \\(P(X) = 0\\) it means the event \\(X\\) is impossible (i.e., I never wear those trousers). On the other hand, if \\(P(X) = 1\\) it means that event \\(X\\) is certain to occur (i.e., I always wear those trousers). For probability values in the middle it means that I sometimes wear those trousers. For instance, if \\(P(X) = 0.5\\) it means that I wear those trousers half of the time. At this point, were almost done. The last thing we need to recognise is that something always happens. Every time I put on trousers, I really do end up wearing trousers (crazy, right?). What this somewhat trite statement means, in probabilistic terms, is that the probabilities of the elementary events need to add up to 1. This is known as the law of total probability, not that any of us really care. More importantly, if these requirements are satisfied then what we have is a probability distribution. For example, this is an example of a probability distribution: Which trousers? Label Probability Blue jeans \\(X_1\\) \\(P(X_1) = .5\\) Grey jeans \\(X_2\\) \\(P(X_2) = .3\\) Black jeans \\(X_3\\) \\(P(X_3) = .1\\) Black suit \\(X_4\\) \\(P(X_4) = 0\\) Blue tracksuit \\(X_5\\) \\(P(X_5) = .1\\) Each of the events has a probability that lies between 0 and 1, and if we add up the probability of all events they sum to 1. Awesome. We can even draw a nice bar graph (see Section 5.3) to visualise this distribution, as shown in Figure 7.2. And, at this point, weve all achieved something. Youve learned what a probability distribution is, and Ive finally managed to find a way to create a graph that focuses entirely on my trousers. Everyone wins! Figure 7.2: A visual depiction of the pants probability distribution. There are five elementary events, corresponding to the five pairs of pants that I own. Each event has some probability of occurring: this probability is a number between 0 to 1. The sum of these probabilities is 1. The only other thing that I need to point out is that probability theory allows you to talk about non elementary events as well as elementary ones. The easiest way to illustrate the concept is with an example. In the trousers example its perfectly legitimate to refer to the probability that I wear jeans. In this scenario, the Dan wears jeans event is said to have happened as long as the elementary event that actually did occur is one of the appropriate ones. In this case blue jeans, black jeans or grey jeans. In mathematical terms we defined the jeans event \\(E\\) to correspond to the set of elementary events \\((X_1, X_2, X_3)\\). If any of these elementary events occurs then \\(E\\) is also said to have occurred. Having decided to write down the definition of the \\(E\\) this way, its pretty straightforward to state what the probability \\(P(E)\\) is: we just add everything up. In this particular case \\[ P(E) = P(X_1) + P(X_2) + P(X_3) \\] and, since the probabilities of blue, grey and black jeans respectively are .5, .3 and .1, the probability that I wear jeans is equal to .9. At this point you might be thinking that this is all terribly obvious and simple and youd be right. All weve really done is wrap some basic mathematics around a few common sense intuitions. However, from these simple beginnings its possible to construct some extremely powerful mathematical tools. Im definitely not going to go into the details in this book, but what I will do is list, in Table 7.1, some of the other rules that probabilities satisfy. These rules can be derived from the simple assumptions that Ive outlined above, but since we dont actually use these rules for anything in this book I wont do so here. Table 7.1: Some basic rules that probabilities must satisfy. You dont really need to know these rules in order to understand the analyses that well talk about later in the book, but they are important if you want to understand probability theory a bit more deeply. English Notation X. Formula Not \\(A\\) \\(P(\\neg A)\\) = \\(1-P(A)\\) \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) \\(P(A \\cup B)\\) = \\(P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B)\\) \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) \\(P(A \\cap B)\\) = \\(P(A \\vert B) P(B)\\) 7.4 The binomial distribution As you might imagine, probability distributions vary enormously and theres an enormous range of distributions out there. However, they arent all equally important. In fact, the vast majority of the content in this book relies on one of five distributions: the binomial distribution, the normal distribution, the \\(t\\) distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) distribution and the \\(F\\) distribution. Given this, what Ill do over the next few sections is provide a brief introduction to all five of these, paying special attention to the binomial and the normal. Ill start with the binomial distribution since its the simplest of the five. 7.4.1 Introducing the binomial The theory of probability originated in the attempt to describe how games of chance work, so it seems fitting that our discussion of the binomial distribution should involve a discussion of rolling dice and flipping coins. Lets imagine a simple experiment. In my hot little hand Im holding 20 identical six-sided dice. On one face of each die theres a picture of a skull, the other five faces are all blank. If I proceed to roll all 20 dice, whats the probability that Ill get exactly 4 skulls? Assuming that the dice are fair, we know that the chance of any one die coming up skulls is 1 in 6. To say this another way, the skull probability for a single die is approximately \\(.167\\). This is enough information to answer our question, so lets have a look at how its done. Table 7.2: Formulas for the binomial and normal distributions. We dont really use these formulas for anything in this book, but theyre pretty important for more advanced work, so I thought it might be best to put them here in a table, where they cant get in the way of the text. In the equation for the binomial, \\(X!\\) is the factorial function (i.e., multiply all whole numbers from 1 to \\(X\\)), and for the normal distribution exp refers to the exponential function, which we discussed in the Chapter on Data Handling. If these equations dont make a lot of sense to you, dont worry too much about them. Binomial Normal \\(P(X \\ \\vert \\ \\theta, N) = \\displaystyle\\frac{N!}{X! (N-X)!} \\theta^X (1-\\theta)^{N-X}\\) \\(p(X \\vert \\mu, \\sigma) = \\displaystyle\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma} \\exp \\left( -\\frac{(X - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2} \\right)\\) As usual, well want to introduce some names and some notation. Well let \\(N\\) denote the number of dice rolls in our experiment, which is often referred to as the size parameter of our binomial distribution. Well also use \\(\\theta\\) to refer to the the probability that a single die comes up skulls, a quantity that is usually called the success probability of the binomial.39 Finally, well use \\(X\\) to refer to the results of our experiment, namely the number of skulls I get when I roll the dice. Since the actual value of \\(X\\) is due to chance we refer to it as a random variable. In any case, now that we have all this terminology and notation we can use it to state the problem a little more precisely. The quantity that we want to calculate is the probability that \\(X = 4\\) given that we know that \\(\\theta = .167\\) and \\(N=20\\). The general form of the thing Im interested in calculating could be written as \\[ P(X \\ | \\ \\theta, N) \\] and were interested in the special case where \\(X=4\\), \\(\\theta = .167\\) and \\(N=20\\). Theres only one more piece of notation I want to refer to before moving on to discuss the solution to the problem. If I want to say that \\(X\\) is generated randomly from a binomial distribution with parameters \\(\\theta\\) and \\(N\\), the notation I would use is as follows: \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Binomial}(\\theta, N) \\] Yeah, yeah. I know what youre thinking: notation, notation, notation. Really, who cares? Very few readers of this book are here for the notation, so I should probably move on and talk about how to use the binomial distribution. Ive included the formula for the binomial distribution in Table 7.2, since some readers may want to play with it themselves, but since most people probably dont care that much and because we dont need the formula in this book, I wont talk about it in any detail. Instead, I just want to show you what the binomial distribution looks like. Figure 7.3: The binomial distribution with size parameter of \\(N=20\\) and an underlying success probability of \\(theta = 1/6\\). Each vertical bar depicts the probability of one specific outcome (i.e., one possible value of \\(X\\)). Because this is a probability distribution, each of the probabilities must be a number between 0 and 1, and the heights of the bars must sum to 1 as well. To that end, Figure 7.3 plots the binomial probabilities for all possible values of \\(X\\) for our dice rolling experiment, from \\(X=0\\) (no skulls) all the way up to \\(X=20\\) (all skulls). Note that this is basically a bar chart, and is no different to the trousers probability plot I drew in Figure 7.2. On the horizontal axis we have all the possible events, and on the vertical axis we can read off the probability of each of those events. So, the probability of rolling 4 skulls out of 20 is about 0.20 (the actual answer is 0.2022036, as well see in a moment). In other words, youd expect that to happen about 20% of the times you repeated this experiment. To give you a feel for how the binomial distribution changes when we alter the values of \\(\\theta\\) and \\(N\\), lets suppose that instead of rolling dice Im actually flipping coins. This time around, my experiment involves flipping a fair coin repeatedly and the outcome that Im interested in is the number of heads that I observe. In this scenario, the success probability is now \\(\\theta = 1/2\\). Suppose I were to flip the coin \\(N=20\\) times. In this example, Ive changed the success probability but kept the size of the experiment the same. What does this do to our binomial distribution? Well, as Figure 7.4 shows, the main effect of this is to shift the whole distribution, as youd expect. Okay, what if we flipped a coin \\(N=100\\) times? Well, in that case we get Figure 7.5. The distribution stays roughly in the middle but theres a bit more variability in the possible outcomes. Figure 7.4: Two binomial distributions, involving a scenario in which Im flipping a fair coin, so the underlying success probability is \\(theta = 1/2\\). Here we assume Im flipping the coin \\(N=20\\) times. Figure 7.5: Two binomial distributions, involving a scenario in which Im flipping a fair coin, so the underlying success probability is \\(theta = 1/2\\). Here we assume that the coin is flipped \\(N=100\\) times. 7.5 The normal distribution Figure 7.6: The normal distribution with mean \\(mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(sigma = 1\\). The \\(x\\)-axis corresponds to the value of some variable, and the \\(y\\)-axis tells us something about how likely we are to observe that value. However, notice that the \\(y\\)-axis is labelled Probability Density and not Probability. There is a subtle and somewhat frustrating characteristic of continuous distributions that makes the \\(y\\) axis behave a bit oddly: the height of the curve here isnt actually the probability of observing a particular \\(x\\) value. On the other hand, it is true that the heights of the curve tells you which \\(x\\) values are more likely (the higher ones!). While the binomial distribution is conceptually the simplest distribution to understand, its not the most important one. That particular honour goes to the normal distribution, also referred to as the bell curve or a Gaussian distribution. A normal distribution is described using two parameters: the mean of the distribution \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation of the distribution \\(\\sigma\\). The notation that we sometimes use to say that a variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed is as follows: \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Normal}(\\mu,\\sigma) \\] Of course, thats just notation. It doesnt tell us anything interesting about the normal distribution itself. As was the case with the binomial distribution, I have included the formula for the normal distribution in this book, because I think its important enough that everyone who learns statistics should at least look at it, but since this is an introductory text I dont want to focus on it, so Ive tucked it away in Table 7.2. Figure 7.7: An illustration of what happens when you change the mean of a normal distribution. The solid line depicts a normal distribution with a mean of \\(mu=4\\). The dashed line shows a normal distribution with a mean of \\(mu=7\\). In both cases, the standard deviation is \\(sigma=1\\). Not surprisingly, the two distributions have the same shape, but the dashed line is shifted to the right. Figure 7.8: An illustration of what happens when you change the the standard deviation of a normal distribution. Both distributions plotted in this figure have a mean of \\(mu = 5\\), but they have different standard deviations. The solid line plots a distribution with standard deviation \\(sigma=1\\), and the dashed line shows a distribution with standard deviation \\(sigma = 2\\). As a consequence, both distributions are centred on the same spot, but the dashed line is wider than the solid one. Instead of focusing on the maths, lets try to get a sense for what it means for a variable to be normally distributed. To that end, have a look at Figure 7.6 which plots a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu = 0\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma = 1\\). You can see where the name bell curve comes from; it looks a bit like a bell. Notice that, unlike the plots that I drew to illustrate the binomial distribution, the picture of the normal distribution in Figure 7.6 shows a smooth curve instead of histogram-like bars. This isnt an arbitrary choice, the normal distribution is continuous whereas the binomial is discrete. For instance, in the die rolling example from the last section it was possible to get 3 skulls or 4 skulls, but impossible to get 3.9 skulls. The figures that I drew in the previous section reflected this fact. In Figure 7.3, for instance, theres a bar located at \\(X=3\\) and another one at \\(X=4\\) but theres nothing in between. Continuous quantities dont have this constraint. For instance, suppose were talking about the weather. The temperature on a pleasant Spring day could be 23 degrees, 24 degrees, 23.9 degrees, or anything in between since temperature is a continuous variable. And so a normal distribution might be quite appropriate for describing Spring temperatures.40 With this in mind, lets see if we cant get an intuition for how the normal distribution works. First, lets have a look at what happens when we play around with the parameters of the distribution. To that end, Figure 7.7 plots normal distributions that have different means but have the same standard deviation. As you might expect, all of these distributions have the same width. The only difference between them is that theyve been shifted to the left or to the right. In every other respect theyre identical. In contrast, if we increase the standard deviation while keeping the mean constant, the peak of the distribution stays in the same place but the distribution gets wider, as you can see in Figure 7.8. Notice, though, that when we widen the distribution the height of the peak shrinks. This has to happen, in the same way that the heights of the bars that we used to draw a discrete binomial distribution have to sum to 1, the total area under the curve for the normal distribution must equal 1. Before moving on, I want to point out one important characteristic of the normal distribution. Irrespective of what the actual mean and standard deviation are, 68.3% of the area falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean. Similarly, 95.4% of the distribution falls within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% of the distribution is within 3 standard deviations. This idea is illustrated in Figure 7.9 and 7.10. Figure 7.9: The area under the curve tells you the probability that an observation falls within a particular range. The solid lines plot normal distributions with mean \\(mu=0\\) and standard deviation \\(sigma=1\\) The shaded areas illustrate areas under the curve for two important cases. On the left, we can see that there is a 68.3% chance that an observation will fall within one standard deviation of the mean. On the right, we see that there is a 95.4% chance that an observation will fall within two standard deviations of the mean Figure 7.10: Two more examples of the area under the curve idea. There is a 15.9% chance that an observation is one standard deviation below the mean or smaller (left), and a 34.1% chance that the observation is greater than one standard deviation below the mean but still below the mean (right). Notice that if you add these two numbers together you get 15.9% + 34.1% = 50%. For normally distributed data, there is a 50% chance that an observation falls below the mean. And of course that also implies that there is a 50% chance that it falls above the mean. 7.5.1 Probability density Theres something Ive been trying to hide throughout my discussion of the normal distribution, something that some introductory textbooks omit completely. They might be right to do so. This thing that Im hiding is weird and counter-intuitive even by the admittedly distorted standards that apply in statistics. Fortunately, its not something that you need to understand at a deep level in order to do basic statistics. Rather, its something that starts to become important later on when you move beyond the basics. So, if it doesnt make complete sense, dont worry too much, but try to make sure that you follow the gist of it. Throughout my discussion of the normal distribution theres been one or two things that dont quite make sense. Perhaps you noticed that the \\(y\\)-axis in these figures is labelled Probability Density rather than density. Maybe you noticed that I used \\(p(X)\\) instead of \\(P(X)\\) when giving the formula for the normal distribution. As it turns out, what is presented here isnt actually a probability, its something else. To understand what that something is you have to spend a little time thinking about what it really means to say that \\(X\\) is a continuous variable. Lets say were talking about the temperature outside. The thermometer tells me its 23 degrees, but I know thats not really true. Its not exactly 23 degrees. Maybe its 23.1 degrees, I think to myself. But I know that thats not really true either because it might actually be 23.09 degrees. But I know that well, you get the idea. The tricky thing with genuinely continuous quantities is that you never really know exactly what they are. Now think about what this implies when we talk about probabilities. Suppose that tomorrows maximum temperature is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 23 and standard deviation 1. Whats the probability that the temperature will be exactly 23 degrees? The answer is zero, or possibly a number so close to zero that it might as well be zero. Why is this? Its like trying to throw a dart at an infinitely small dart board. No matter how good your aim, youll never hit it. In real life youll never get a value of exactly 23. Itll always be something like 23.1 or 22.99998 or suchlike. In other words, its completely meaningless to talk about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees. However, in everyday language if I told you that it was 23 degrees outside and it turned out to be 22.9998 degrees you probably wouldnt call me a liar. Because in everyday language 23 degrees usually means something like somewhere between 22.5 and 23.5 degrees. And while it doesnt feel very meaningful to ask about the probability that the temperature is exactly 23 degrees, it does seem sensible to ask about the probability that the temperature lies between 22.5 and 23.5, or between 20 and 30, or any other range of temperatures. The point of this discussion is to make clear that when were talking about continuous distributions its not meaningful to talk about the probability of a specific value. However, what we can talk about is the probability that the value lies within a particular range of values. To find out the probability associated with a particular range what you need to do is calculate the area under the curve. Weve seen this concept already, in Figure ?? the shaded areas shown depict genuine probabilities (e.g., in Figure ??a it shows the probability of observing a value that falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean). Okay, so that explains part of the story. Ive explained a little bit about how continuous probability distributions should be interpreted (i.e., area under the curve is the key thing). But what does the formula for \\(p(x)\\) that I described earlier actually mean? Obviously, \\(p(x)\\) doesnt describe a probability, but what is it? The name for this quantity \\(p(x)\\) is a probability density, and in terms of the plots weve been drawing it corresponds to the height of the curve. The densities themselves arent meaningful in and of themselves, but theyre rigged to ensure that the area under the curve is always interpretable as genuine probabilities. To be honest, thats about as much as you really need to know for now.41 7.6 Other useful distributions The normal distribution is the distribution that statistics makes most use of (for reasons to be discussed shortly), and the binomial distribution is a very useful one for lots of purposes. But the world of statistics is filled with probability distributions, some of which well run into in passing. In particular, the three that will appear in this book are the \\(t\\) distribution, the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution and the \\(F\\) distribution. I wont give formulas for any of these, or talk about them in too much detail, but I will show you some pictures. Figure 7.11: A \\(t\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (solid line). It looks similar to a normal distribution, but its not quite the same. For comparison purposes, Ive plotted a standard normal distribution as the dashed line. Note that the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution are heavier (i.e., extend further outwards) than the tails of the normal distribution? Thats the important difference between the two. Figure 7.12: A \\(chi^2\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom. Notice that the observed values must always be greater than zero, and that the distribution is pretty skewed. These are the key features of a chi-square distribution. Figure 7.13: An \\(F\\) distribution with 3 and 5 degrees of freedom. Qualitatively speaking, it looks pretty similar to a chi-square distribution, but theyre not quite the same in general. The \\(t\\) distribution is a continuous distribution that looks very similar to a normal distribution, see Figure 7.11. Note that the tails of the \\(t\\) distribution are heavier (i.e., extend further outwards) than the tails of the normal distribution). Thats the important difference between the two. This distribution tends to arise in situations where you think that the data actually follow a normal distribution, but you dont know the mean or standard deviation. Well run into this distribution again in Chapter ??. The \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is another distribution that turns up in lots of different places. The situation in which well see it is when doing categorical data analysis (Chapter 10, but its one of those things that actually pops up all over the place. When you dig into the maths (and who doesnt love doing that?), it turns out that the main reason why the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution turns up all over the place is that if you have a bunch of variables that are normally distributed, square their values and then add them up (a procedure referred to as taking a sum of squares), this sum has a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution. Youd be amazed how often this fact turns out to be useful. Anyway, heres what a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution looks like: Figure 7.12. The \\(F\\) distribution looks a bit like a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution, and it arises whenever you need to compare two \\(\\chi^2\\) distributions to one another. Admittedly, this doesnt exactly sound like something that any sane person would want to do, but it turns out to be very important in real world data analysis. Remember when I said that \\(\\chi^2\\) turns out to be the key distribution when were taking a sum of squares? Well, what that means is if you want to compare two different sums of squares, youre probably talking about something that has an \\(F\\) distribution. Of course, as yet I still havent given you an example of anything that involves a sum of squares, but I will in Chapter ??. And thats where well run into the \\(F\\) distribution. Oh, and theres a picture in Figure 7.13. Okay, time to wrap this section up. Weve seen three new distributions: \\(\\chi^2\\), \\(t\\) and \\(F\\). Theyre all continuous distributions, and theyre all closely related to the normal distribution. The main thing for our purposes is that you grasp the basic idea that these distributions are all deeply related to one another, and to the normal distribution. Later on in this book were going to run into data that are normally distributed, or at least assumed to be normally distributed. What I want you to understand right now is that, if you make the assumption that your data are normally distributed, you shouldnt be surprised to see \\(\\chi^2\\), \\(t\\) and \\(F\\) distributions popping up all over the place when you start trying to do your data analysis. 7.7 Summary In this chapter weve talked about probability. Weve talked about what probability means and why statisticians cant agree on what it means. We talked about the rules that probabilities have to obey. And we introduced the idea of a probability distribution and spent a good chunk of the chapter talking about some of the more important probability distributions that statisticians work with. The section by section breakdown looks like this: Probability theory versus statistics (Section 7.1) Frequentist versus Bayesian views of probability (Section 7.2) Basics of probability theory (Section 7.3) Binomial distribution (Section 7.4), normal distribution (Section 7.5), and others (Section 7.6) As youd expect, my coverage is by no means exhaustive. Probability theory is a large branch of mathematics in its own right, entirely separate from its application to statistics and data analysis. As such, there are thousands of books written on the subject and universities generally offer multiple classes devoted entirely to probability theory. Even the simpler task of documenting standard probability distributions is a big topic. Ive described five standard probability distributions in this chapter, but sitting on my bookshelf I have a 45-chapter book called Statistical Distributions (M. Evans, Hastings, and Peacock 2011) that lists a lot more than that. Fortunately for you, very little of this is necessary. Youre unlikely to need to know dozens of statistical distributions when you go out and do real world data analysis, and you definitely wont need them for this book, but it never hurts to know that theres other possibilities out there. Picking up on that last point, theres a sense in which this whole chapter is something of a digression. Many undergraduate psychology classes on statistics skim over this content very quickly (I know mine did), and even the more advanced classes will often forget to revisit the basic foundations of the field. Most academic psychologists would not know the difference between probability and density, and until recently very few would have been aware of the difference between Bayesian and frequentist probability. However, I think its important to understand these things before moving onto the applications. For example, there are a lot of rules about what youre allowed to say when doing statistical inference and many of these can seem arbitrary and weird. However, they start to make sense if you understand that there is this Bayesian/frequentist distinction. Similarly, in Chapter ?? were going to talk about something called the \\(t\\)-test, and if you really want to have a grasp of the mechanics of the \\(t\\)-test it really helps to have a sense of what a \\(t\\)-distribution actually looks like. You get the idea, I hope.

As discussed in Chapter 4, the role of descriptive statistics is to concisely summarise what we do know. In contrast, the purpose of inferential statistics is to learn what we do not know from what we do. Now that we have a foundation in probability theory we are in a good position to think about the problem of statistical inference. What kinds of things would we like to learn about? And how do we learn them? These are the questions that lie at the heart of inferential statistics, and they are traditionally divided into two big ideas: estimation and hypothesis testing. The goal in this chapter is to introduce the first of these big ideas, estimation theory, but Im going to witter on about sampling theory first because estimation theory doesnt make sense until you understand sampling. As a consequence, this chapter divides naturally into two parts Sections 8.1 through 8.3 are focused on sampling theory, and Sections 8.4 and 8.5 make use of sampling theory to discuss how statisticians think about estimation. 8.1 Samples, populations and sampling In the prelude to Part I discussed the riddle of induction and highlighted the fact that all learning requires you to make assumptions. Accepting that this is true, our first task to come up with some fairly general assumptions about data that make sense. This is where sampling theory comes in. If probability theory is the foundations upon which all statistical theory builds, sampling theory is the frame around which you can build the rest of the house. Sampling theory plays a huge role in specifying the assumptions upon which your statistical inferences rely. And in order to talk about making inferences the way statisticians think about it we need to be a bit more explicit about what it is that were drawing inferences from (the sample) and what it is that were drawing inferences about (the population). In almost every situation of interest what we have available to us as researchers is a sample of data. We might have run experiment with some number of participants, a polling company might have phoned some number of people to ask questions about voting intentions, and so on. In this way the data set available to us is finite and incomplete. We cant possibly get every person in the world to do our experiment, for example a polling company doesnt have the time or the money to ring up every voter in the country. In our earlier discussion of descriptive statistics (Chapter 4) this sample was the only thing we were interested in. Our only goal was to find ways of describing, summarising and graphing that sample. This is about to change. 8.1.1 Defining a population A sample is a concrete thing. You can open up a data file and theres the data from your sample. A population, on the other hand, is a more abstract idea. It refers to the set of all possible people, or all possible observations, that you want to draw conclusions about and is generally much bigger than the sample. In an ideal world the researcher would begin the study with a clear idea of what the population of interest is, since the process of designing a study and testing hypotheses with the data does depend on the population about which you want to make statements. Sometimes its easy to state the population of interest. For instance, in the polling company example that opened the chapter the population consisted of all voters enrolled at the time of the study, millions of people. The sample was a set of 1000 people who all belong to that population. In most studies the situation is much less straightforward. In a typical psychological experiment determining the population of interest is a bit more complicated. Suppose I run an experiment using 100 undergraduate students as my participants. My goal, as a cognitive scientist, is to try to learn something about how the mind works. So, which of the following would count as the population: All of the undergraduate psychology students at the University of Adelaide? Undergraduate psychology students in general, anywhere in the world? Australians currently living? Australians of similar ages to my sample? Anyone currently alive? Any human being, past, present or future? Any biological organism with a sufficient degree of intelligence operating in a terrestrial environment? Any intelligent being? Each of these defines a real group of mind-possessing entities, all of which might be of interest to me as a cognitive scientist, and its not at all clear which one ought to be the true population of interest. As another example, consider the Wellesley-Croker game that we discussed in the prelude. The sample here is a specific sequence of 12 wins and 0 losses for Wellesley. What is the population? All outcomes until Wellesley and Croker arrived at their destination? All outcomes if Wellesley and Croker had played the game for the rest of their lives? All outcomes if Wellseley and Croker lived forever and played the game until the world ran out of hills? All outcomes if we created an infinite set of parallel universes and the Wellesely/Croker pair made guesses about the same 12 hills in each universe? Again, its not obvious what the population is. 8.1.2 Simple random samples Irrespective of how I define the population, the critical point is that the sample is a subset of the population and our goal is to use our knowledge of the sample to draw inferences about the properties of the population. The relationship between the two depends on the procedure by which the sample was selected. This procedure is referred to as a sampling method and it is important to understand why it matters. To keep things simple, lets imagine that we have a bag containing 10 chips. Each chip has a unique letter printed on it so we can distinguish between the 10 chips. The chips come in two colours, black and white. This set of chips is the population of interest and it is depicted graphically on the left of Figure 8.1. As you can see from looking at the picture there are 4 black chips and 6 white chips, but of course in real life we wouldnt know that unless we looked in the bag. Now imagine you run the following experiment: you shake up the bag, close your eyes, and pull out 4 chips without putting any of them back into the bag. First out comes the \\(a\\) chip (black), then the \\(c\\) chip (white), then \\(j\\) (white) and then finally \\(b\\) (black). If you wanted you could then put all the chips back in the bag and repeat the experiment, as depicted on the right hand side of Figure 8.1. Each time you get different results but the procedure is identical in each case. The fact that the same procedure can lead to different results each time we refer to as a random process.42 However, because we shook the bag before pulling any chips out, it seems reasonable to think that every chip has the same chance of being selected. A procedure in which every member of the population has the same chance of being selected is called a simple random sample. The fact that we did not put the chips back in the bag after pulling them out means that you cant observe the same thing twice, and in such cases the observations are said to have been sampled without replacement. Figure 8.1: Simple random sampling without replacement from a finite population To help make sure you understand the importance of the sampling procedure, consider an alternative way in which the experiment could have been run. Suppose that my 5-year old son had opened the bag and decided to pull out four black chips without putting any of them back in the bag. This biased sampling scheme is depicted in Figure 8.2. Now consider the evidential value of seeing 4 black chips and 0 white chips. Clearly it depends on the sampling scheme, does it not? If you know that the sampling scheme is biased to select only black chips then a sample that consists of only black chips doesnt tell you very much about the population! For this reason statisticians really like it when a data set can be considered a simple random sample, because it makes the data analysis much easier. Figure 8.2: Biased sampling without replacement from a finite population A third procedure is worth mentioning. This time around we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. This time, however, we record the observation and then put the chip back in the bag. Again we close our eyes, shake the bag, and pull out a chip. We then repeat this procedure until we have 4 chips. Data sets generated in this way are still simple random samples, but because we put the chips back in the bag immediately after drawing them it is referred to as a sample with replacement. The difference between this situation and the first one is that it is possible to observe the same population member multiple times, as illustrated in Figure 8.3. Figure 8.3: Simple random sampling with replacement from a finite population In my experience, most psychology experiments tend to be sampling without replacement, because the same person is not allowed to participate in the experiment twice. However, most statistical theory is based on the assumption that the data arise from a simple random sample with replacement. In real life this very rarely matters. If the population of interest is large (e.g., has more than 10 entities!) the difference between sampling with- and without- replacement is too small to be concerned with. The difference between simple random samples and biased samples, on the other hand, is not such an easy thing to dismiss. 8.1.3 Most samples are not simple random samples As you can see from looking at the list of possible populations that I showed above, it is almost impossible to obtain a simple random sample from most populations of interest. When I run experiments Id consider it a minor miracle if my participants turned out to be a random sampling of the undergraduate psychology students at Adelaide university, even though this is by far the narrowest population that I might want to generalise to. A thorough discussion of other types of sampling schemes is beyond the scope of this book, but to give you a sense of whats out there Ill list a few of the more important ones. Stratified sampling. Suppose your population is (or can be) divided into several different sub-populations, or strata. Perhaps youre running a study at several different sites, for example. Instead of trying to sample randomly from the population as a whole, you instead try to collect a separate random sample from each of the strata. Stratified sampling is sometimes easier to do than simple random sampling, especially when the population is already divided into the distinct strata. It can also be more efficient than simple random sampling, especially when some of the sub-populations are rare. For instance, when studying schizophrenia it would be much better to divide the population into two43 strata (schizophrenic and not-schizophrenic) and then sample an equal number of people from each group. If you selected people randomly you would get so few schizophrenic people in the sample that your study would be useless. This specific kind of of stratified sampling is referred to as oversampling because it makes a deliberate attempt to over-represent rare groups. Snowball sampling is a technique that is especially useful when sampling from a hidden or hard to access population and is especially common in social sciences. For instance, suppose the researchers want to conduct an opinion poll among transgender people. The research team might only have contact details for a few trans folks, so the survey starts by asking them to participate (stage 1). At the end of the survey the participants are asked to provide contact details for other people who might want to participate. In stage 2 those new contacts are surveyed. The process continues until the researchers have sufficient data. The big advantage to snowball sampling is that it gets you data in situations that might otherwise be impossible to get any. On the statistical side, the main disadvantage is that the sample is highly non-random, and non-random in ways that are difficult to address. On the real life side, the disadvantage is that the procedure can be unethical if not handled well, because hidden populations are often hidden for a reason. I chose transgender people as an example here to highlight this issue. If you werent careful you might end up outing people who dont want to be outed (very, very bad form), and even if you dont make that mistake it can still be intrusive to use peoples social networks to study them. Its certainly very hard to get peoples informed consent before contacting them, yet in many cases the simple act of contacting them and saying hey we want to study you can be hurtful. Social networks are complex things, and just because you can use them to get data doesnt always mean you should. Convenience sampling is more or less what it sounds like. The samples are chosen in a way that is convenient to the researcher, and not selected at random from the population of interest. Snowball sampling is one type of convenience sampling, but there are many others. A common example in psychology are studies that rely on undergraduate psychology students. These samples are generally non-random in two respects. First, reliance on undergraduate psychology students automatically means that your data are restricted to a single sub-population. Second, the students usually get to pick which studies they participate in, so the sample is a self selected subset of psychology students and not a randomly selected subset. In real life most studies are convenience samples of one form or another. This is sometimes a severe limitation, but not always. 8.1.4 How much does it matter if you dont have a simple random sample? Okay, so real world data collection tends not to involve nice simple random samples. Does that matter? A little thought should make it clear to you that it can matter if your data are not a simple random sample. Just think about the difference between Figures 8.1 and 8.2. However, its not quite as bad as it sounds. Some types of biased samples are entirely unproblematic. For instance, when using a stratified sampling technique you actually know what the bias is because you created it deliberately, often to increase the effectiveness of your study, and there are statistical techniques that you can use to adjust for the biases youve introduced (not covered in this book!). So in those situations its not a problem. More generally though, its important to remember that random sampling is a means to an end, and not the end in itself. Lets assume youve relied on a convenience sample, and as such you can assume its biased. A bias in your sampling method is only a problem if it causes you to draw the wrong conclusions. When viewed from that perspective, Id argue that we dont need the sample to be randomly generated in every respect, we only need it to be random with respect to the psychologically-relevant phenomenon of interest. Suppose Im doing a study looking at working memory capacity. In study 1, I actually have the ability to sample randomly from all human beings currently alive, with one exception: I can only sample people born on a Monday. In study 2, I am able to sample randomly from the Australian population. I want to generalise my results to the population of all living humans. Which study is better? The answer, obviously, is study 1. Why? Because we have no reason to think that being born on a Monday has any interesting relationship to working memory capacity. In contrast, I can think of several reasons why being Australian might matter. Australia is a wealthy, industrialised country with a very well-developed education system. People growing up in that system will have had life experiences much more similar to the experiences of the people who designed the tests for working memory capacity. This shared experience might easily translate into similar beliefs about how to take a test, a shared assumption about how psychological experimentation works, and so on. These things might actually matter. For instance, test taking style might have taught the Australian participants how to direct their attention exclusively on fairly abstract test materials much more than people who havent grown up in a similar environment. This could therefore lead to a misleading picture of what working memory capacity is. There are two points hidden in this discussion. First, when designing your own studies, its important to think about what population you care about and try hard to sample in a way that is appropriate to that population. In practice, youre usually forced to put up with a sample of convenience (e.g., psychology lecturers sample psychology students because thats the least expensive way to collect data, and our coffers arent exactly overflowing with gold), but if so you should at least spend some time thinking about what the dangers of this practice might be. Second, if youre going to criticise someone elses study because theyve used a sample of convenience rather than laboriously sampling randomly from the entire human population, at least have the courtesy to offer a specific theory as to how this might have distorted the results. 8.1.5 Population parameters and sample statistics Okay. Setting aside the thorny methodological issues associated with obtaining a random sample, lets consider a slightly different issue. Up to this point we have been talking about populations the way a scientist might. To a psychologist a population might be a group of people. To an ecologist a population might be a group of bears. In most cases the populations that scientists care about are concrete things that actually exist in the real world. Statisticians, however, are a funny lot. On the one hand, they are interested in real world data and real science in the same way that scientists are. On the other hand, they also operate in the realm of pure abstraction in the way that mathematicians do. As a consequence, statistical theory tends to be a bit abstract in how a population is defined. In much the same way that psychological researchers operationalise our abstract theoretical ideas in terms of concrete measurements (Section 2.1), statisticians operationalise the concept of a population in terms of mathematical objects that they know how to work with. Youve already come across these objects in Chapter 7. Theyre called probability distributions. The idea is quite simple. Lets say were talking about IQ scores. To a psychologist the population of interest is a group of actual humans who have IQ scores. A statistician simplifies this by operationally defining the population as the probability distribution depicted in Figure 8.4a. IQ tests are designed so that the average IQ is 100, the standard deviation of IQ scores is 15, and the distribution of IQ scores is normal. These values are referred to as the population parameters because they are characteristics of the entire population. That is, we say that the population mean \\(\\mu\\) is 100 and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) is 15. Figure 8.4: The population distribution of IQ scores (panel a) and two samples drawn randomly from it. In panel b we have a sample of 100 observations, and panel c we have a sample of 10,000 observations. Now suppose I run an experiment. I select 100 people at random and administer an IQ test, giving me a simple random sample from the population. My sample would consist of a collection of numbers like this: 106 101 98 80 74 ... 107 72 100 Each of these IQ scores is sampled from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15. So if I plot a histogram of the sample I get something like the one shown in Figure 8.4b. As you can see, the histogram is roughly the right shape but its a very crude approximation to the true population distribution shown in Figure 8.4a. When I calculate the mean of my sample, I get a number that is fairly close to the population mean 100 but not identical. In this case, it turns out that the people in my sample have a mean IQ of 98.5, and the standard deviation of their IQ scores is 15.9. These sample statistics are properties of my data set, and although they are fairly similar to the true population values they are not the same. In general, sample statistics are the things you can calculate from your data set and the population parameters are the things you want to learn about. Later on in this chapter Ill talk about how you can estimate population parameters using your sample statistics (Section 8.4) and how to work out how confident you are in your estimates (Section 8.5) but before we get to that theres a few more ideas in sampling theory that you need to know about. 8.2 The law of large numbers In the previous section I showed you the results of one fictitious IQ experiment with a sample size of \\(N=100\\). The results were somewhat encouraging as the true population mean is 100 and the sample mean of 98.5 is a pretty reasonable approximation to it. In many scientific studies that level of precision is perfectly acceptable, but in other situations you need to be a lot more precise. If we want our sample statistics to be much closer to the population parameters, what can we do about it? The obvious answer is to collect more data. Suppose that we ran a much larger experiment, this time measuring the IQs of 10,000 people. We can simulate the results of this experiment using jamovi. The IQsim.omv file is a jamovi data file. In this file I have generated 10,000 random numbers sampled from a normal distribution for a population with mean = 100 and sd = 15. This was done by computing a new variable using the = NORM(100,15) function. A histogram and density plot shows that this larger sample is a much better approximation to the true population distribution than the smaller one. This is reflected in the sample statistics. The mean IQ for the larger sample turns out to be 99.68 and the standard deviation is 14.90. These values are now very close to the true population. See Figure 8.5 Figure 8.5: A random sample drawn from a normal distribution using jamovi I feel a bit silly saying this, but the thing I want you to take away from this is that large samples generally give you better information. I feel silly saying it because its so bloody obvious that it shouldnt need to be said. In fact, its such an obvious point that when Jacob Bernoulli, one of the founders of probability theory, formalised this idea back in 1713 he was kind of a jerk about it. Heres how he described the fact that we all share this intuition: For even the most stupid of men, by some instinct of nature, by himself and without any instruction (which is a remarkable thing), is convinced that the more observations have been made, the less danger there is of wandering from ones goal (see Stigler 1986, p65) Okay, so the passage comes across as a bit condescending (not to mention sexist), but his main point is correct. It really does feel obvious that more data will give you better answers. The question is, why is this so? Not surprisingly, this intuition that we all share turns out to be correct, and statisticians refer to it as the law of large numbers. The law of large numbers is a mathematical law that applies to many different sample statistics but the simplest way to think about it is as a law about averages. The sample mean is the most obvious example of a statistic that relies on averaging (because thats what the mean is an average), so lets look at that. When applied to the sample mean what the law of large numbers states is that as the sample gets larger, the sample mean tends to get closer to the true population mean. Or, to say it a little bit more precisely, as the sample size approaches infinity (written as \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\)), the sample mean approaches the population mean (\\(\\bar{X} \\rightarrow \\mu\\)).^[Technically, the law of large numbers pertains to any sample statistic that can be described as an average of independent quantities. Thats certainly true for the sample mean. However, its also possible to write many other sample statistics as averages of one form or another. The variance of a sample, for instance, can be rewritten as a kind of average and so is subject to the law of large numbers. The minimum value of a sample, however, cannot be written as an average of anything and is therefore not governed by the law of large numbers.] I dont intend to subject you to a proof that the law of large numbers is true, but its one of the most important tools for statistical theory. The law of large numbers is the thing we can use to justify our belief that collecting more and more data will eventually lead us to the truth. For any particular data set the sample statistics that we calculate from it will be wrong, but the law of large numbers tells us that if we keep collecting more data those sample statistics will tend to get closer and closer to the true population parameters. 8.3 Sampling distributions and the central limit theorem The law of large numbers is a very powerful tool but its not going to be good enough to answer all our questions. Among other things, all it gives us is a long run guarantee. In the long run, if we were somehow able to collect an infinite amount of data, then the law of large numbers guarantees that our sample statistics will be correct. But as John Maynard Keynes famously argued in economics, a long run guarantee is of little use in real life. [The] long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead. Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task, if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us, that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again. (Keynes 1923, ~80) As in economics, so too in psychology and statistics. It is not enough to know that we will eventually arrive at the right answer when calculating the sample mean. Knowing that an infinitely large data set will tell me the exact value of the population mean is cold comfort when my actual data set has a sample size of \\(N=100\\). In real life, then, we must know something about the behaviour of the sample mean when it is calculated from a more modest data set! 8.3.1 Sampling distribution of the mean With this in mind, lets abandon the idea that our studies will have sample sizes of 10,000 and consider instead a very modest experiment indeed. This time around well sample \\(N=5\\) people and measure their IQ scores. As before, I can simulate this experiment in jamovi = NORM(100,15) function, but I only need 5 participant IDs this time, not 10,000. These are the five numbers that jamovi generated: 90 82 94 99 110 The mean IQ in this sample turns out to be exactly 95. Not surprisingly, this is much less accurate than the previous experiment. Now imagine that I decided to replicate the experiment. That is, I repeat the procedure as closely as possible and I randomly sample 5 new people and measure their IQ. Again, jamovi allows me to simulate the results of this procedure, and generates these five numbers: 78 88 111 111 117 This time around, the mean IQ in my sample is 101. If I repeat the experiment 10 times I obtain the results shown in Table 8.1, and as you can see the sample mean varies from one replication to the next. Table 8.1: Ten replications of the IQ experiment, each with a sample size of \\(N=5\\). Person 1 Person 2 Person 3 Person 4 Person 5 Sample mean Replication 1 90 82 94 99 110 95.0 Replication 2 78 88 111 111 117 101.0 Replication 3 111 122 91 98 86 101.6 Replication 4 98 96 119 99 107 103.8 Replication 5 105 113 103 103 98 104.4 Replication 6 81 89 93 85 114 92.4 Replication 7 100 93 108 98 133 106.4 Replication 8 107 100 105 117 85 102.8 Replication 9 86 119 108 73 116 100.4 Replication 10 95 126 112 120 76 105.8 Now suppose that I decided to keep going in this fashion, replicating this five IQ scores experiment over and over again. Every time I replicate the experiment I write down the sample mean. Over time, Id be amassing a new data set, in which every experiment generates a single data point. The first 10 observations from my data set are the sample means listed in Table 8.1, so my data set starts out like this: 95.0 101.0 101.6 103.8 104.4 ... What if I continued like this for 10,000 replications, and then drew a histogram. Well thats exactly what I did, and you can see the results in Figure 8.6. As this picture illustrates, the average of 5 IQ scores is usually between 90 and 110. But more importantly, what it highlights is that if we replicate an experiment over and over again, what we end up with is a distribution of sample means! This distribution has a special name in statistics, its called the sampling distribution of the mean. Sampling distributions are another important theoretical idea in statistics, and theyre crucial for understanding the behaviour of small samples. For instance, when I ran the very first five IQ scores experiment, the sample mean turned out to be 95. What the sampling distribution in Figure 8.6 tells us, though, is that the five IQ scores experiment is not very accurate. If I repeat the experiment, the sampling distribution tells me that I can expect to see a sample mean anywhere between 80 and 120. Figure 8.6: The sampling distribution of the mean for the five IQ scores experiment. If you sample 5 people at random and calculate their *average} IQ youll almost certainly get a number between 80 and 120, even though there are quite a lot of individuals who have IQs above 120 or below 80. For comparison, the black line plots the population distribution of IQ scores. 8.3.2 Sampling distributions exist for any sample statistic! One thing to keep in mind when thinking about sampling distributions is that any sample statistic you might care to calculate has a sampling distribution. For example, suppose that each time I replicated the five IQ scores experiment I wrote down the largest IQ score in the experiment. This would give me a data set that started out like this: 110 117 122 119 113 ... Doing this over and over again would give me a very different sampling distribution, namely the sampling distribution of the maximum. The sampling distribution of the maximum of 5 IQ scores is shown in Figure 8.7. Not surprisingly, if you pick 5 people at random and then find the person with the highest IQ score, theyre going to have an above average IQ. Most of the time youll end up with someone whose IQ is measured in the 100 to 140 range. Figure 8.7: The sampling distribution of the maximum for the five IQ scores experiment. If you sample 5 people at random and select the one with the highest IQ score youll probably see someone with an IQ between 100 and 140. 8.3.3 The central limit theorem Figure 8.8: An illustration of the how sampling distribution of the mean depends on sample size. In each panel I generated 10,000 samples of IQ data and calculated the mean IQ observed within each of these data sets. The histograms in these plots show the distribution of these means (i.e., the sampling distribution of the mean). Each individual IQ score was drawn from a normal distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15, which is shown as the solid black line. In panel a, each data set contained only a single observation, so the mean of each sample is just one persons IQ score. As a consequence, the sampling distribution of the mean is of course identical to the population distribution of IQ scores. However, when we raise the sample size to 2 the mean of any one sample tends to be closer to the population mean than a one persons IQ score, and so the histogram (i.e., the sampling distribution) is a bit narrower than the population distribution. By the time we raise the sample size to 10 (panel c), we can see that the distribution of sample means tend to be fairly tightly clustered around the true population mean. At this point I hope you have a pretty good sense of what sampling distributions are, and in particular what the sampling distribution of the mean is. In this section I want to talk about how the sampling distribution of the mean changes as a function of sample size. Intuitively, you already know part of the answer. If you only have a few observations, the sample mean is likely to be quite inaccurate. If you replicate a small experiment and recalculate the mean youll get a very different answer. In other words, the sampling distribution is quite wide. If you replicate a large experiment and recalculate the sample mean youll probably get the same answer you got last time, so the sampling distribution will be very narrow. You can see this visually in Figure 8.8, showing that the bigger the sample size, the narrower the sampling distribution gets. We can quantify this effect by calculating the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, which is referred to as the standard error. The standard error of a statistic is often denoted SE, and since were usually interested in the standard error of the sample mean, we often use the acronym SEM. As you can see just by looking at the picture, as the sample size \\(N\\) increases, the SEM decreases. Okay, so thats one part of the story. However, theres something Ive been glossing over so far. All my examples up to this point have been based on the IQ scores experiments, and because IQ scores are roughly normally distributed Ive assumed that the population distribution is normal. What if it isnt normal? What happens to the sampling distribution of the mean? The remarkable thing is this, no matter what shape your population distribution is, as \\(N\\) increases the sampling distribution of the mean starts to look more like a normal distribution. To give you a sense of this I ran some simulations. To do this, I started with the ramped distribution shown in the histogram in Figure 8.9. As you can see by comparing the triangular shaped histogram to the bell curve plotted by the black line, the population distribution doesnt look very much like a normal distribution at all. Next, I simulated the results of a large number of experiments. In each experiment I took \\(N=2\\) samples from this distribution, and then calculated the sample mean. Figure 8.9b plots the histogram of these sample means (i.e., the sampling distribution of the mean for \\(N=2\\)). This time, the histogram produces a \\(\\cap\\)-shaped distribution. Its still not normal, but its a lot closer to the black line than the population distribution in Figure 8.9a. When I increase the sample size to \\(N=4\\), the sampling distribution of the mean is very close to normal (Figure 8.9c), and by the time we reach a sample size of \\(N=8\\) its almost perfectly normal. In other words, as long as your sample size isnt tiny, the sampling distribution of the mean will be approximately normal no matter what your population distribution looks like! Figure 8.9: A demonstration of the central limit theorem. In panel a, we have a non-normal population distribution, and panels b-d show the sampling distribution of the mean for samples of size 2,4 and 8 for data drawn from the distribution in panel a. As you can see, even though the original population distribution is non-normal the sampling distribution of the mean becomes pretty close to normal by the time you have a sample of even 4 observations. On the basis of these figures, it seems like we have evidence for all of the following claims about the sampling distribution of the mean. The mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the mean of the population The standard deviation of the sampling distribution (i.e., the standard error) gets smaller as the sample size increases The shape of the sampling distribution becomes normal as the sample size increases As it happens, not only are all of these statements true, there is a very famous theorem in statistics that proves all three of them, known as the central limit theorem. Among other things, the central limit theorem tells us that if the population distribution has mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\), then the sampling distribution of the mean also has mean \\(\\mu\\) and the standard error of the mean is \\[ \\mbox{SEM} = \\frac{\\sigma}{ \\sqrt{N} } \\] Because we divide the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) by the square root of the sample size \\(N\\), the SEM gets smaller as the sample size increases. It also tells us that the shape of the sampling distribution becomes normal.44 This result is useful for all sorts of things. It tells us why large experiments are more reliable than small ones, and because it gives us an explicit formula for the standard error it tells us how much more reliable a large experiment is. It tells us why the normal distribution is, well, normal. In real experiments, many of the things that we want to measure are actually averages of lots of different quantities (e.g., arguably, general intelligence as measured by IQ is an average of a large number of specific skills and abilities), and when that happens, the averaged quantity should follow a normal distribution. Because of this mathematical law, the normal distribution pops up over and over again in real data. 8.4 Estimating population parameters In all the IQ examples in the previous sections we actually knew the population parameters ahead of time. As every undergraduate gets taught in their very first lecture on the measurement of intelligence, IQ scores are defined to have mean 100 and standard deviation 15. However, this is a bit of a lie. How do we know that IQ scores have a true population mean of 100? Well, we know this because the people who designed the tests have administered them to very large samples, and have then rigged the scoring rules so that their sample has mean 100. Thats not a bad thing of course, its an important part of designing a psychological measurement. However, its important to keep in mind that this theoretical mean of 100 only attaches to the population that the test designers used to design the tests. Good test designers will actually go to some lengths to provide test norms that can apply to lots of different populations (e.g., different age groups, nationalities etc). This is very handy, but of course almost every research project of interest involves looking at a different population of people to those used in the test norms. For instance, suppose you wanted to measure the effect of low level lead poisoning on cognitive functioning in Port Pirie, a South Australian industrial town with a lead smelter. Perhaps you decide that you want to compare IQ scores among people in Port Pirie to a comparable sample in Whyalla, a South Australian industrial town with a steel refinery.45 Regardless of which town youre thinking about, it doesnt make a lot of sense simply to assume that the true population mean IQ is 100. No-one has, to my knowledge, produced sensible norming data that can automatically be applied to South Australian industrial towns. Were going to have to estimate the population parameters from a sample of data. So how do we do this? 8.4.1 Estimating the population mean Suppose we go to Port Pirie and 100 of the locals are kind enough to sit through an IQ test. The average IQ score among these people turns out to be \\(\\bar{X}=98.5\\). So what is the true mean IQ for the entire population of Port Pirie? Obviously, we dont know the answer to that question. It could be \\(97.2\\), but it could also be \\(103.5\\). Our sampling isnt exhaustive so we cannot give a definitive answer. Nevertheless, if I was forced at gunpoint to give a best guess Id have to say \\(98.5\\). Thats the essence of statistical estimation: giving a best guess. In this example estimating the unknown poulation parameter is straightforward. I calculate the sample mean and I use that as my estimate of the population mean. Its pretty simple, and in the next section Ill explain the statistical justification for this intuitive answer. However, for the moment what I want to do is make sure you recognise that the sample statistic and the estimate of the population parameter are conceptually different things. A sample statistic is a description of your data, whereas the estimate is a guess about the population. With that in mind, statisticians often different notation to refer to them. For instance, if the true population mean is denoted \\(\\mu\\), then we would use \\(\\hat\\mu\\) to refer to our estimate of the population mean. In contrast, the sample mean is denoted \\(\\bar{X}\\) or sometimes \\(m\\). However, in simple random samples the estimate of the population mean is identical to the sample mean. If I observe a sample mean of \\(\\bar{X} = 98.5\\) then my estimate of the population mean is also \\(\\hat\\mu = 98.5\\). To help keep the notation clear, heres a handy table: Symbol What is it? Do we know what it is \\(\\bar{X}\\) Sample mean Yes calculated from the raw data \\(\\mu\\) True population mean Almost never known for sure \\(\\hat{\\mu}\\) Estimate of the population mean Yes identical to the sample mean 8.4.2 Estimating the population standard deviation So far, estimation seems pretty simple, and you might be wondering why I forced you to read through all that stuff about sampling theory. In the case of the mean our estimate of the population parameter (i.e. \\(\\hat\\mu\\)) turned out to identical to the corresponding sample statistic (i.e. \\(\\bar{X}\\)). However, thats not always true. To see this, lets have a think about how to construct an estimate of the population standard deviation, which well denote \\(\\hat\\sigma\\). What shall we use as our estimate in this case? Your first thought might be that we could do the same thing we did when estimating the mean, and just use the sample statistic as our estimate. Thats almost the right thing to do, but not quite. Heres why. Suppose I have a sample that contains a single observation. For this example, it helps to consider a sample where you have no intuitions at all about what the true population values might be, so lets use something completely fictitious. Suppose the observation in question measures the cromulence of my shoes. It turns out that my shoes have a cromulence of 20. So heres my sample: 20 This is a perfectly legitimate sample, even if it does have a sample size of \\(N=1\\). It has a sample mean of 20 and because every observation in this sample is equal to the sample mean (obviously!) it has a sample standard deviation of 0. As a description of the sample this seems quite right, the sample contains a single observation and therefore there is no variation observed within the sample. A sample standard deviation of \\(s = 0\\) is the right answer here. But as an estimate of the population standard deviation it feels completely insane, right? Admittedly, you and I dont know anything at all about what cromulence is, but we know something about data. The only reason that we dont see any variability in the sample is that the sample is too small to display any variation! So, if you have a sample size of \\(N=1\\) it feels like the right answer is just to say no idea at all. Notice that you dont have the same intuition when it comes to the sample mean and the population mean. If forced to make a best guess about the population mean it doesnt feel completely insane to guess that the population mean is 20. Sure, you probably wouldnt feel very confident in that guess because you have only the one observation to work with, but its still the best guess you can make. Lets extend this example a little. Suppose I now make a second observation. My data set now has \\(N=2\\) observations of the cromulence of shoes, and the complete sample now looks like this: 20, 22 This time around, our sample is just large enough for us to be able to observe some variability: two observations is the bare minimum number needed for any variability to be observed! For our new data set, the sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}=21\\), and the sample standard deviation is \\(s=1\\). What intuitions do we have about the population? Again, as far as the population mean goes, the best guess we can possibly make is the sample mean. If forced to guess wed probably guess that the population mean cromulence is 21. What about the standard deviation? This is a little more complicated. The sample standard deviation is only based on two observations, and if youre at all like me you probably have the intuition that, with only two observations we havent given the population enough of a chance to reveal its true variability to us. Its not just that we suspect that the estimate is wrong, after all with only two observations we expect it to be wrong to some degree. The worry is that the error is systematic. Specifically, we suspect that the sample standard deviation is likely to be smaller than the population standard deviation. Figure 8.10: The sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation for a two IQ scores experiment. The true population standard deviation is 15 (dashed line), but as you can see from the histogram the vast majority of experiments will produce a much smaller sample standard deviation than this. On average, this experiment would produce a sample standard deviation of only 8.5, well below the true value! In other words, the sample standard deviation is a biased estimate of the population standard deviation. This intuition feels right, but it would be nice to demonstrate this somehow. There are in fact mathematical proofs that confirm this intuition, but unless you have the right mathematical background they dont help very much. Instead, what Ill do is simulate the results of some experiments. With that in mind, lets return to our IQ studies. Suppose the true population mean IQ is 100 and the standard deviation is 15. First Ill conduct an experiment in which I measure \\(N=2\\) IQ scores and Ill calculate the sample standard deviation. If I do this over and over again, and plot a histogram of these sample standard deviations, what I have is the sampling distribution of the standard deviation. Ive plotted this distribution in Figure 8.10. Even though the true population standard deviation is 15 the average of the sample standard deviations is only 8.5. Notice that this is a very different result to what we found in Figure 8.8b when we plotted the sampling distribution of the mean, where the population mean is 100 and the average of the sample means is also 100. Now lets extend the simulation. Instead of restricting ourselves to the situation where \\(N=2\\), lets repeat the exercise for sample sizes from 1 to 10. If we plot the average sample mean and average sample standard deviation as a function of sample size, you get the results shown in Figure 8.11. On the left hand side (panel a) Ive plotted the average sample mean and on the right hand side (panel b) Ive plotted the average standard deviation. The two plots are quite different:on average, the average sample mean is equal to the population mean. It is an unbiased estimator, which is essentially the reason why your best estimate for the population mean is the sample mean.46 The plot on the right is quite different: on average, the sample standard deviation \\(s\\) is smaller than the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). It is a biased estimator. In other words, if we want to make a best guess \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) about the value of the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) we should make sure our guess is a little bit larger than the sample standard deviation \\(s\\). Figure 8.11: An illustration of the fact that the sample mean is an unbiased estimator of the population mean (panel a), but the sample standard deviation is a biased estimator of the population standard deviation (panel b). For the figure I generated 10,000 simulated data sets with 1 observation each, 10,000 more with 2 observations, and so on up to a sample size of 10. Each data set consisted of fake IQ data, that is the data were normally distributed with a true population mean of 100 and standard deviation 15. On average, the sample means turn out to be 100, regardless of sample size (panel a). However, the sample standard deviations turn out to be systematically too small (panel b), especially for small sample sizes. The fix to this systematic bias turns out to be very simple. Heres how it works. Before tackling the standard deviation lets look at the variance. If you recall from Section 4.2, the sample variance is defined to be the average of the squared deviations from the sample mean. That is: \\[ s^2 = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\] The sample variance \\(s^2\\) is a biased estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). But as it turns out, we only need to make a tiny tweak to transform this into an unbiased estimator. All we have to do is divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than by \\(N\\). If we do that, we obtain the following formula: \\[ \\hat\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\] This is an unbiased estimator of the population variance \\(\\sigma\\). Moreover, this finally answers the question we raised in Section 4.2. Why did jamovi give us slightly different answers for variance? Its because jamovi calculates \\(\\hat\\sigma^2\\) not \\(s^2\\), thats why. A similar story applies for the standard deviation. If we divide by \\(N-1\\) rather than \\(N\\) our estimate of the population standard deviation becomes: \\[ \\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \\bar{X})^2} \\] and when we use jamovis built in standard deviation function, what its doing is calculating \\(\\hat\\sigma\\), not \\(s\\).47 One final point. In practice, a lot of people tend to refer to \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) (i.e., the formula where we divide by \\(N-1\\)) as the sample standard deviation. Technically, this is incorrect. The sample standard deviation should be equal to \\(s\\) (i.e., the formula where we divide by \\(N\\)). These arent the same thing, either conceptually or numerically. One is a property of the sample, the other is an estimated characteristic of the population. However, in almost every real life application what we actually care about is the estimate of the population parameter, and so people always report \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) rather than \\(s\\). This is the right number to report, of course. Its just that people tend to get a little bit imprecise about terminology when they write it up, because sample standard deviation is shorter than estimated population standard deviation. Its no big deal, and in practice I do the same thing everyone else does. Nevertheless, I think its important to keep the two concepts separate. Its never a good idea to confuse known properties of your sample with guesses about the population from which it came. The moment you start thinking that \\(s\\) and \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) are the same thing, you start doing exactly that. To finish this section off, heres another couple of tables to help keep things clear. Symbol What is it? Do we know what it is? \\(s\\) Sample standard deviation Yes - calculated from the raw data \\(\\sigma\\) Population standard deviation Almost never known for sure \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) Estimate of the population standard deviation Yes - but not the same as the sample standard deviation \\(s^2\\) Sample variance Yes - calculated from the raw data \\(\\sigma^2\\) Population variance Almost never known for sure \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) Estimate of the population variance Yes - but not the same as the sample variance 8.5 Estimating a confidence interval Statistics means never having to say youre certain Unknown origin48 Up to this point in this chapter, Ive outlined the basics of sampling theory which statisticians rely on to make guesses about population parameters on the basis of a sample of data. As this discussion illustrates, one of the reasons we need all this sampling theory is that every data set leaves us with a some of uncertainty, so our estimates are never going to be perfectly accurate. The thing that has been missing from this discussion is an attempt to quantify the amount of uncertainty that attaches to our estimate. Its not enough to be able guess that, say, the mean IQ of undergraduate psychology students is 115 (yes, I just made that number up). We also want to be able to say something that expresses the degree of certainty that we have in our guess. For example, it would be nice to be able to say that there is a 95% chance that the true mean lies between 109 and 121. The name for this is a confidence interval for the mean. Armed with an understanding of sampling distributions, constructing a confidence interval for the mean is actually pretty easy. Heres how it works. Suppose the true population mean is \\(\\mu\\) and the standard deviation is \\(\\sigma\\). Ive just finished running my study that has \\(N\\) participants, and the mean IQ among those participants is \\(\\bar{X}\\). We know from our discussion of the central limit theorem (Section 8.3.3) that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. We also know from our discussion of the normal distribution Section 7.5 that there is a 95% chance that a normally-distributed quantity will fall within about two standard deviations of the true mean. To be more precise, the more correct answer is that there is a 95% chance that a normally-distributed quantity will fall within 1.96 standard deviations of the true mean. Next, recall that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is referred to as the standard error, and the standard error of the mean is written as SEM. When we put all these pieces together, we learn that there is a 95% probability that the sample mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) that we have actually observed lies within 1.96 standard errors of the population mean. Mathematically, we write this as: \\[ \\mu - \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM} \\right) \\ \\leq \\ \\bar{X}\\ \\leq \\ \\mu + \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM} \\right) \\] where the SEM is equal to \\(\\sigma / \\sqrt{N}\\) and we can be 95% confident that this is true. However, thats not answering the question that were actually interested in. The equation above tells us what we should expect about the sample mean given that we know what the population parameters are. What we want is to have this work the other way around. We want to know what we should believe about the population parameters, given that we have observed a particular sample. However, its not too difficult to do this. Using a little high school algebra, a sneaky way to rewrite our equation is like this: \\[ \\bar{X} - \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM} \\right) \\ \\leq \\ \\mu \\ \\leq \\ \\bar{X} + \\left( 1.96 \\times \\mbox{SEM}\\right) \\] What this is telling is is that the range of values has a 95% probability of containing the population mean \\(\\mu\\). We refer to this range as a 95% confidence interval, denoted \\(\\mbox{CI}_{95}\\). In short, as long as \\(N\\) is sufficiently large (large enough for us to believe that the sampling distribution of the mean is normal), then we can write this as our formula for the 95% confidence interval: \\[ \\mbox{CI}_{95} = \\bar{X} \\pm \\left( 1.96 \\times \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}} \\right) \\] Of course, theres nothing special about the number 1.96. It just happens to be the multiplier you need to use if you want a 95% confidence interval. If Id wanted a 70% confidence interval, I would have used 1.04 as the magic number rather than 1.96. 8.5.1 A slight mistake in the formula As usual, I lied. The formula that Ive given above for the 95% confidence interval is approximately correct, but I glossed over an important detail in the discussion. Notice my formula requires you to use the standard error of the mean, SEM, which in turn requires you to use the true population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). Yet, in Section 8.4 I stressed the fact that we dont actually know the true population parameters. Because we dont know the true value of \\(\\sigma\\) we have to use an estimate of the population standard deviation \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\) instead. This is pretty straightforward to do, but this has the consequence that we need to use the percentiles of the \\(t\\)-distribution rather than the normal distribution to calculate our magic number, and the answer depends on the sample size. When \\(N\\) is very large, we get pretty much the same value using the \\(t\\)-distribution or the normal distribution: 1.96. But when \\(N\\) is small we get a much bigger number when we use the \\(t\\) distribution: 2.26. Theres nothing too mysterious about whats happening here. Bigger values mean that the confidence interval is wider, indicating that were more uncertain about what the true value of \\(\\mu\\) actually is. When we use the \\(t\\) distribution instead of the normal distribution we get bigger numbers, indicating that we have more uncertainty. And why do we have that extra uncertainty? Well, because our estimate of the population standard deviation \\(\\hat\\sigma\\) might be wrong! If its wrong, it implies that were a bit less sure about what our sampling distribution of the mean actually looks like, and this uncertainty ends up getting reflected in a wider confidence interval. 8.5.2 Interpreting a confidence interval The hardest thing about confidence intervals is understanding what they mean. Whenever people first encounter confidence intervals, the first instinct is almost always to say that there is a 95% probability that the true mean lies inside the confidence interval. Its simple and it seems to capture the common sense idea of what it means to say that I am 95% confident. Unfortunately, its not quite right. The intuitive definition relies very heavily on your own personal beliefs about the value of the population mean. I say that I am 95% confident because those are my beliefs. In everyday life thats perfectly okay, but if you remember back to Section 7.2, youll notice that talking about personal belief and confidence is a Bayesian idea. However, confidence intervals are not Bayesian tools. Like everything else in this chapter, confidence intervals are frequentist tools, and if you are going to use frequentist methods then its not appropriate to attach a Bayesian interpretation to them. If you use frequentist methods, you must adopt frequentist interpretations! Okay, so if thats not the right answer, what is? Remember what we said about frequentist probability. The only way we are allowed to make probability statements is to talk about a sequence of events, and to count up the frequencies of different kinds of events. From that perspective, the interpretation of a 95% confidence interval must have something to do with replication. Specifically, if we replicated the experiment over and over again and computed a 95% confidence interval for each replication, then 95% of those intervals would contain the true mean. More generally, 95% of all confidence intervals constructed using this procedure should contain the true population mean. This idea is illustrated in Figure 8.12, which shows 50 confidence intervals constructed for a measure 10 IQ scores experiment (top panel) and another 50 confidence intervals for a measure 25 IQ scores experiment (bottom panel). A bit fortuitously, across the 100 replications that I simulated, it turned out that exactly 95 of them contained the true mean. Figure 8.12: 95% confidence intervals. The top (panel a) shows 50 simulated replications of an experiment in which we measure the IQs of 10 people. The dot marks the location of the sample mean and the line shows the 95% confidence interval. In total 47 of the 50 confidence intervals do contain the true mean (i.e., 100), but the three intervals marked with asterisks do not. The lower graph (panel b) shows a similar simulation, but this time we simulate replications of an experiment that measures the IQs of 25 people. The critical difference here is that the Bayesian claim makes a probability statement about the population mean (i.e., it refers to our uncertainty about the population mean), which is not allowed under the frequentist interpretation of probability because you cant replicate a population! In the frequentist claim, the population mean is fixed and no probabilistic claims can be made about it. Confidence intervals, however, are repeatable so we can replicate experiments. Therefore a frequentist is allowed to talk about the probability that the confidence interval (a random variable) contains the true mean, but is not allowed to talk about the probability that the true population mean (not a repeatable event) falls within the confidence interval. I know that this seems a little pedantic, but it does matter. It matters because the difference in interpretation leads to a difference in the mathematics. There is a Bayesian alternative to confidence intervals, known as credible intervals. In most situations credible intervals are quite similar to confidence intervals, but in other cases they are drastically different. As promised, though, Ill talk more about the Bayesian perspective in Chapter ??. 8.5.3 Calculating confidence intervals in jamovi As far as I can tell, jamovi does not (yet) include a simple way to calculate confidence intervals for the mean as part of the Descriptives functionality. But the Descriptives do have a check box for the S.E. Mean, so you can use this to calculate the lower 95% confidence interval as: Mean - (1.96 * S.E. Mean) , and the upper 95% confidence interval as: Mean + (1.96 * S.E. Mean) 95% confidence intervals are the de facto standard in psychology. So, for example, if I load the IQsim.omv file, check mean and S.E mean under Descriptives, I can work out the confidence interval associated with the simulated mean IQ: Lower 95% CI = 99.68 - (1.96 * 0.15) = 99.39 Upper 95% CI = 99.68 + (1.96 * 0.15) = 99.98 So, in our simulated large sample data with N=10,000, the mean IQ score is 99.68 with a 95% CI from 99.39 to 99.98. Hopefully thats fairly clear. So, although there currently is not a straightforward way to get jamovi to calculate the confidence interval as part of the variable Descriptives options, if we wanted to we could pretty easily work it out by hand. Similarly, when it comes to plotting confidence intervals in jamovi, this is not (yet) available as part of the Descriptives options. However, when we get onto learning about specific statistical tests, for example in Chapter ??, we will see that we can plot confidence intervals as part of the data analysis. Thats pretty cool, so well show you how to do that later on. 8.6 Summary In this chapter Ive covered two main topics. The first half of the chapter talks about sampling theory, and the second half talks about how we can use sampling theory to construct estimates of the population parameters. The section breakdown looks like this: Basic ideas about samples, sampling and populations (Section 8.1) Statistical theory of sampling: the law of large numbers (Section 8.2), sampling distributions and the central limit theorem (Section 8.3). Estimating means and standard deviations (Section 8.4) Estimating a confidence interval (Section 8.5) As always, theres a lot of topics related to sampling and estimation that arent covered in this chapter, but for an introductory psychology class this is fairly comprehensive I think. For most applied researchers you wont need much more theory than this. One big question that I havent touched on in this chapter is what you do when you dont have a simple random sample. There is a lot of statistical theory you can draw on to handle this situation, but its well beyond the scope of this book.

This process, however, has no logical foundation but only a psychological one. It is clear that there are no grounds for believing that the simplest course of events will really happen. It is an hypothesis that the sun will rise tomorrow: and this means that we do not know whether it will rise.  Ludwig Wittgenstein49 In the last chapter I discussed the ideas behind estimation, which is one of the two big ideas in inferential statistics. Its now time to turn our attention to the other big idea, which is hypothesis testing. In its most abstract form, hypothesis testing is really a very simple idea. The researcher has some theory about the world and wants to determine whether or not the data actually support that theory. However, the details are messy and most people find the theory of hypothesis testing to be the most frustrating part of statistics. The structure of the chapter is as follows. First, Ill describe how hypothesis testing works in a fair amount of detail, using a simple running example to show you how a hypothesis test is built. Ill try to avoid being too dogmatic while doing so, and focus instead on the underlying logic of the testing procedure.50 Afterwards, Ill spend a bit of time talking about the various dogmas, rules and heresies that surround the theory of hypothesis testing. 9.1 A menagerie of hypotheses Eventually we all succumb to madness. For me, that day will arrive once Im finally promoted to full professor. Safely ensconced in my ivory tower, happily protected by tenure, I will finally be able to take leave of my senses (so to speak) and indulge in that most thoroughly unproductive line of psychological research, the search for extrasensory perception (ESP).51 Lets suppose that this glorious day has come. My first study is a simple one in which I seek to test whether clairvoyance exists. Each participant sits down at a table and is shown a card by an experimenter. The card is black on one side and white on the other. The experimenter takes the card away and places it on a table in an adjacent room. The card is placed black side up or white side up completely at random, with the randomisation occurring only after the experimenter has left the room with the participant. A second experimenter comes in and asks the participant which side of the card is now facing upwards. Its purely a one-shot experiment. Each person sees only one card and gives only one answer, and at no stage is the participant actually in contact with someone who knows the right answer. My data set, therefore, is very simple. I have asked the question of \\(N\\) people and some number \\(X\\) of these people have given the correct response. To make things concrete, lets suppose that I have tested \\(N = 100\\) people and \\(X = 62\\) of these got the answer right. A surprisingly large number, sure, but is it large enough for me to feel safe in claiming Ive found evidence for ESP? This is the situation where hypothesis testing comes in useful. However, before we talk about how to test hypotheses, we need to be clear about what we mean by hypotheses. 9.1.1 Research hypotheses versus statistical hypotheses The first distinction that you need to keep clear in your mind is between research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. In my ESP study my overall scientific goal is to demonstrate that clairvoyance exists. In this situation I have a clear research goal: I am hoping to discover evidence for ESP. In other situations I might actually be a lot more neutral than that, so I might say that my research goal is to determine whether or not clairvoyance exists. Regardless of how I want to portray myself, the basic point that Im trying to convey here is that a research hypothesis involves making a substantive, testable scientific claim. If you are a psychologist then your research hypotheses are fundamentally about psychological constructs. Any of the following would count as research hypotheses: Listening to music reduces your ability to pay attention to other things. This is a claim about the causal relationship between two psychologically meaningful concepts (listening to music and paying attention to things), so its a perfectly reasonable research hypothesis. Intelligence is related to personality. Like the last one, this is a relational claim about two psychological constructs (intelligence and personality), but the claim is weaker: correlational not causal. Intelligence is speed of information processing. This hypothesis has a quite different character. Its not actually a relational claim at all. Its an ontological claim about the fundamental character of intelligence (and Im pretty sure its wrong). Its worth expanding on this one actually. Its usually easier to think about how to construct experiments to test research hypotheses of the form does X affect Y? than it is to address claims like what is X? And in practice what usually happens is that you find ways of testing relational claims that follow from your ontological ones. For instance, if I believe that intelligence is speed of information processing in the brain, my experiments will often involve looking for relationships between measures of intelligence and measures of speed. As a consequence most everyday research questions do tend to be relational in nature, but theyre almost always motivated by deeper ontological questions about the state of nature. Notice that in practice, my research hypotheses could overlap a lot. My ultimate goal in the ESP experiment might be to test an ontological claim like ESP exists, but I might operationally restrict myself to a narrower hypothesis like Some people can `see objects in a clairvoyant fashion. That said, there are some things that really dont count as proper research hypotheses in any meaningful sense: Love is a battlefield. This is too vague to be testable. Whilst its okay for a research hypothesis to have a degree of vagueness to it, it has to be possible to operationalise your theoretical ideas. Maybe Im just not creative enough to see it, but I cant see how this can be converted into any concrete research design. If thats true then this isnt a scientific research hypothesis, its a pop song. That doesnt mean its not interesting. A lot of deep questions that humans have fall into this category. Maybe one day science will be able to construct testable theories of love, or to test to see if God exists, and so on. But right now we cant, and I wouldnt bet on ever seeing a satisfying scientific approach to either. The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology club. This is not a substantive claim of any kind. Its true by definition. No conceivable state of nature could possibly be inconsistent with this claim. We say that this is an unfalsifiable hypothesis, and as such it is outside the domain of science. Whatever else you do in science your claims must have the possibility of being wrong. More people in my experiment will say yes than no. This one fails as a research hypothesis because its a claim about the data set, not about the psychology (unless of course your actual research question is whether people have some kind of yes bias!). Actually, this hypothesis is starting to sound more like a statistical hypothesis than a research hypothesis. As you can see, research hypotheses can be somewhat messy at times and ultimately they are scientific claims. Statistical hypotheses are neither of these two things. Statistical hypotheses must be mathematically precise and they must correspond to specific claims about the characteristics of the data generating mechanism (i.e., the population). Even so, the intent is that statistical hypotheses bear a clear relationship to the substantive research hypotheses that you care about! For instance, in my ESP study my research hypothesis is that some people are able to see through walls or whatever. What I want to do is to map this onto a statement about how the data were generated. So lets think about what that statement would be. The quantity that Im interested in within the experiment is \\(P(\\mbox{&quot;correct&quot;})\\), the true-but-unknown probability with which the participants in my experiment answer the question correctly. Lets use the Greek letter \\(\\theta\\) (theta) to refer to this probability. Here are four different statistical hypotheses: If ESP doesnt exist and if my experiment is well designed then my participants are just guessing. So I should expect them to get it right half of the time and so my statistical hypothesis is that the true probability of choosing correctly is \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). Alternatively, suppose ESP does exist and participants can see the card. If thats true people will perform better than chance and the statistical hypothesis is that \\(\\theta &gt; 0.5\\). A third possibility is that ESP does exist, but the colours are all reversed and people dont realise it (okay, thats wacky, but you never know). If thats how it works then youd expect peoples performance to be below chance. This would correspond to a statistical hypothesis that \\(\\theta &lt; 0.5\\). Finally, suppose ESP exists but I have no idea whether people are seeing the right colour or the wrong one. In that case the only claim I could make about the data would be that the probability of making the correct answer is not equal to 0.5. This corresponds to the statistical hypothesis that \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\). All of these are legitimate examples of a statistical hypothesis because they are statements about a population parameter and are meaningfully related to my experiment. What this discussion makes clear, I hope, is that when attempting to construct a statistical hypothesis test the researcher actually has two quite distinct hypotheses to consider. First, he or she has a research hypothesis (a claim about psychology), and this then corresponds to a statistical hypothesis (a claim about the data generating population). In my ESP example these might be: Danis research hypothesis Danis statistical hypothesis ESP exists \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\) And a key thing to recognise is this. A statistical hypothesis test is a test of the statistical hypothesis, not the research hypothesis. If your study is badly designed then the link between your research hypothesis and your statistical hypothesis is broken. To give a silly example, suppose that my ESP study was conducted in a situation where the participant can actually see the card reflected in a window. If that happens I would be able to find very strong evidence that \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\), but this would tell us nothing about whether ESP exists. 9.1.2 Null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses So far, so good. I have a research hypothesis that corresponds to what I want to believe about the world, and I can map it onto a statistical hypothesis that corresponds to what I want to believe about how the data were generated. Its at this point that things get somewhat counter-intuitive for a lot of people. Because what Im about to do is invent a new statistical hypothesis (the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\)) that corresponds to the exact opposite of what I want to believe, and then focus exclusively on that almost to the neglect of the thing Im actually interested in (which is now called the alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1\\)). In our ESP example, the null hypothesis is that \\(\\theta = 0.5\\), since thats what wed expect if ESP didnt exist. My hope, of course, is that ESP is totally real and so the alternative to this null hypothesis is \\(\\theta \\neq 0.5\\). In essence, what were doing here is dividing up the possible values of \\(\\theta\\) into two groups: those values that I really hope arent true (the null), and those values that Id be happy with if they turn out to be right (the alternative). Having done so, the important thing to recognise is that the goal of a hypothesis test is not to show that the alternative hypothesis is (probably) true. The goal is to show that the null hypothesis is (probably) false. Most people find this pretty weird. The best way to think about it, in my experience, is to imagine that a hypothesis test is a criminal trial52, the trial of the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is the defendant, the researcher is the prosecutor, and the statistical test itself is the judge. Just like a criminal trial, there is a presumption of innocence. The null hypothesis is deemed to be true unless you, the researcher, can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it is false. You are free to design your experiment however you like (within reason, obviously!) and your goal when doing so is to maximise the chance that the data will yield a conviction for the crime of being false. The catch is that the statistical test sets the rules of the trial and those rules are designed to protect the null hypothesis, specifically to ensure that if the null hypothesis is actually true the chances of a false conviction are guaranteed to be low. This is pretty important. After all, the null hypothesis doesnt get a lawyer, and given that the researcher is trying desperately to prove it to be false someone has to protect it. 9.2 Two types of errors Before going into details about how a statistical test is constructed its useful to understand the philosophy behind it. I hinted at it when pointing out the similarity between a null hypothesis test and a criminal trial, but I should now be explicit. Ideally, we would like to construct our test so that we never make any errors. Unfortunately, since the world is messy, this is never possible. Sometimes youre just really unlucky. For instance, suppose you flip a coin 10 times in a row and it comes up heads all 10 times. That feels like very strong evidence for a conclusion that the coin is biased, but of course theres a 1 in 1024 chance that this would happen even if the coin was totally fair. In other words, in real life we always have to accept that theres a chance that we made a mistake. As a consequence the goal behind statistical hypothesis testing is not to eliminate errors, but to minimise them. At this point, we need to be a bit more precise about what we mean by errors. First, lets state the obvious. It is either the case that the null hypothesis is true or that it is false, and our test will either retain the null hypothesis or reject it.53 So, as the table below illustrates, after we run the test and make our choice one of four things might have happened: retain \\(H_0\\) reject \\(H_0\\) \\(H_0\\) is true correct decision error (type I) \\(H_0\\) is false error (type II) correct decision As a consequence there are actually two different types of error here. If we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true then we have made a type I error. On the other hand, if we retain the null hypothesis when it is in fact false then we have made a type II error. Remember how I said that statistical testing was kind of like a criminal trial? Well, I meant it. A criminal trial requires that you establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did it. All of the evidential rules are (in theory, at least) designed to ensure that theres (almost) no chance of wrongfully convicting an innocent defendant. The trial is designed to protect the rights of a defendant, as the English jurist William Blackstone famously said, it is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer. In other words, a criminal trial doesnt treat the two types of error in the same way. Punishing the innocent is deemed to be much worse than letting the guilty go free. A statistical test is pretty much the same. The single most important design principle of the test is to control the probability of a type I error, to keep it below some fixed probability. This probability, which is denoted \\(\\alpha\\), is called the significance level of the test. And Ill say it again, because it is so central to the whole set-up, a hypothesis test is said to have significance level \\(\\alpha\\) if the type I error rate is no larger than \\(\\alpha\\). So, what about the type II error rate? Well, wed also like to keep those under control too, and we denote this probability by \\(\\beta\\). However, its much more common to refer to the power of the test, that is the probability with which we reject a null hypothesis when it really is false, which is \\(1-\\beta\\). To help keep this straight, heres the same table again but with the relevant numbers added: retain \\(H_0\\) reject \\(H_0\\) \\(H_0\\) is true \\(1-\\alpha\\) (probability of correct retention) \\(\\alpha\\) (type I error rate) \\(H_0\\) is false \\(\\beta\\) (type II error rate) \\(1-\\beta\\) (power of the test) A powerful hypothesis test is one that has a small value of \\(\\beta\\), while still keeping \\(\\alpha\\) fixed at some (small) desired level. By convention, scientists make use of three different \\(\\alpha\\) levels: \\(.05\\), \\(.01\\) and \\(.001\\). Notice the asymmetry here; the tests are designed to ensure that the \\(\\alpha\\) level is kept small but theres no corresponding guarantee regarding \\(\\beta\\). Wed certainly like the type II error rate to be small and we try to design tests that keep it small, but this is typically secondary to the overwhelming need to control the type I error rate. As Blackstone might have said if he were a statistician, it is better to retain 10 false null hypotheses than to reject a single true one. To be honest, I dont know that I agree with this philosophy. There are situations where I think it makes sense, and situations where I think it doesnt, but thats neither here nor there. Its how the tests are built. 9.3 Test statistics and sampling distributions At this point we need to start talking specifics about how a hypothesis test is constructed. To that end, lets return to the ESP example. Lets ignore the actual data that we obtained, for the moment, and think about the structure of the experiment. Regardless of what the actual numbers are, the form of the data is that \\(X\\) out of \\(N\\) people correctly identified the colour of the hidden card. Moreover, lets suppose for the moment that the null hypothesis really is true, that ESP doesnt exist and the true probability that anyone picks the correct colour is exactly \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). What would we expect the data to look like? Well, obviously wed expect the proportion of people who make the correct response to be pretty close to 50%. Or, to phrase this in more mathematical terms, wed say that \\(X/N\\) is approximately \\(0.5\\). Of course, we wouldnt expect this fraction to be exactly 0.5. If, for example, we tested \\(N=100\\) people and \\(X = 53\\) of them got the question right, wed probably be forced to concede that the data are quite consistent with the null hypothesis. On the other hand, if \\(X = 99\\) of our participants got the question right then wed feel pretty confident that the null hypothesis is wrong. Similarly, if only \\(X=3\\) people got the answer right wed be similarly confident that the null was wrong. Lets be a little more technical about this. We have a quantity \\(X\\) that we can calculate by looking at our data. After looking at the value of \\(X\\) we make a decision about whether to believe that the null hypothesis is correct, or to reject the null hypothesis in favour of the alternative. The name for this thing that we calculate to guide our choices is a test statistic. Having chosen a test statistic, the next step is to state precisely which values of the test statistic would cause us to reject the null hypothesis, and which values would cause us to keep it. In order to do so we need to determine what the sampling distribution of the test statistic would be if the null hypothesis were actually true (we talked about sampling distributions earlier in Section 8.3.1). Why do we need this? Because this distribution tells us exactly what values of \\(X\\) our null hypothesis would lead us to expect. And, therefore, we can use this distribution as a tool for assessing how closely the null hypothesis agrees with our data. Figure 9.1: The sampling distribution for our test statistic \\(X\\) when the null hypothesis is true. For our ESP scenario this is a binomial distribution. Not surprisingly, since the null hypothesis says that the probability of a correct response is $ heta = .5$, the sampling distribution says that the most likely value is 50 (out of 100) correct responses. Most of the probability mass lies between 40 and 60. How do we actually determine the sampling distribution of the test statistic? For a lot of hypothesis tests this step is actually quite complicated, and later on in the book youll see me being slightly evasive about it for some of the tests (some of them I dont even understand myself). However, sometimes its very easy. And, fortunately for us, our ESP example provides us with one of the easiest cases. Our population parameter \\(\\theta\\) is just the overall probability that people respond correctly when asked the question, and our test statistic \\(X\\) is the count of the number of people who did so out of a sample size of \\(N\\). Weve seen a distribution like this before, in Section 7.4, and thats exactly what the binomial distribution describes! So, to use the notation and terminology that I introduced in that section, we would say that the null hypothesis predicts that \\(X\\) is binomially distributed, which is written \\[ X \\sim \\mbox{Binomial}(\\theta,N) \\] Since the null hypothesis states that \\(\\theta = 0.5\\) and our experiment has \\(N=100\\) people, we have the sampling distribution we need. This sampling distribution is plotted in Figure 9.1. No surprises really, the null hypothesis says that \\(X=50\\) is the most likely outcome, and it says that were almost certain to see somewhere between 40 and 60 correct responses. 9.4 Making decisions Okay, were very close to being finished. Weve constructed a test statistic (\\(X\\)) and we chose this test statistic in such a way that were pretty confident that if \\(X\\) is close to \\(N/2\\) then we should retain the null, and if not we should reject it. The question that remains is this. Exactly which values of the test statistic should we associate with the null hypothesis, and exactly which values go with the alternative hypothesis? In my ESP study, for example, Ive observed a value of \\(X=62\\). What decision should I make? Should I choose to believe the null hypothesis or the alternative hypothesis? 9.4.1 Critical regions and critical values To answer this question we need to introduce the concept of a critical region for the test statistic \\(X\\). The critical region of the test corresponds to those values of \\(X\\) that would lead us to reject null hypothesis (which is why the critical region is also sometimes called the rejection region). How do we find this critical region? Well, lets consider what we know: \\(X\\) should be very big or very small in order to reject the null hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is true, the sampling distribution of \\(X\\) is Binomial\\((0.5, N)\\). If \\(\\alpha =.05\\), the critical region must cover 5% of this sampling distribution. Its important to make sure you understand this last point. The critical region corresponds to those values of \\(X\\) for which we would reject the null hypothesis, and the sampling distribution in question describes the probability that we would obtain a particular value of \\(X\\) if the null hypothesis were actually true. Now, lets suppose that we chose a critical region that covers 20% of the sampling distribution, and suppose that the null hypothesis is actually true. What would be the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null? The answer is of course 20%. And, therefore, we would have built a test that had an \\(\\alpha\\) level of \\(0.2\\). If we want \\(\\alpha = .05\\), the critical region is only allowed to cover 5% of the sampling distribution of our test statistic. As it turns out those three things uniquely solve the problem. Our critical region consists of the most extreme values, known as the tails of the distribution. This is illustrated in Figure 9.2. If we want \\(\\alpha = .05\\) then our critical regions correspond to \\(X \\leq 40\\) and \\(X \\geq 60\\).54 That is, if the number of people saying true is between 41 and 59, then we should retain the null hypothesis. If the number is between 0 to 40, or between 60 to 100, then we should reject the null hypothesis. The numbers 40 and 60 are often referred to as the critical values since they define the edges of the critical region. Figure 9.2: The critical region associated with the hypothesis test for the ESP study, for a hypothesis test with a significance level of \\(\\alpha = .05\\). The plot shows the sampling distribution of \\(X\\) under the null hypothesis (i.e., same as Figure 9.1). The grey bars correspond to those values of \\(X\\) for which we would retain the null hypothesis. The blue (darker shaded) bars show the critical region, those values of \\(X\\) for which we would reject the null. Because the alternative hypothesis is two sided (i.e., allows both \\(\\theta &lt;.5\\) and \\(\\theta &gt;.5\\)), the critical region covers both tails of the distribution. To ensure an \\(\\alpha\\) level of \\(.05\\), we need to ensure that each of the two regions encompasses 2.5% of the sampling distribution. At this point, our hypothesis test is essentially complete: we choose an \\(\\alpha\\) level (e.g., \\(\\alpha = .05\\); come up with some test statistic (e.g., \\(X\\)) that does a good job (in some meaningful sense) of comparing \\(H_0\\) to \\(H_1\\); figure out the sampling distribution of the test statistic on the assumption that the null hypothesis is true (in this case, binomial); and then calculate the critical region that produces an appropriate \\(\\alpha\\) level (0-40 and 60-100). All that we have to do now is calculate the value of the test statistic for the real data (e.g., \\(X = 62\\)) and then compare it to the critical values to make our decision. Since 62 is greater than the critical value of 60 we would reject the null hypothesis. Or, to phrase it slightly differently, we say that the test has produced a statistically significant result. 9.4.2 A note on statistical significance Like other occult techniques of divination, the statistical method has a private jargon deliberately contrived to obscure its methods from non-practitioners.  Attributed to G. O. Ashley55 A very brief digression is in order at this point, regarding the word significant. The concept of statistical significance is actually a very simple one, but has a very unfortunate name. If the data allow us to reject the null hypothesis, we say that the result is statistically significant, which is often shortened to the result is significant. This terminology is rather old and dates back to a time when significant just meant something like indicated, rather than its modern meaning which is much closer to important. As a result, a lot of modern readers get very confused when they start learning statistics because they think that a significant result must be an important one. It doesnt mean that at all. All that statistically significant means is that the data allowed us to reject a null hypothesis. Whether or not the result is actually important in the real world is a very different question, and depends on all sorts of other things. 9.4.3 The difference between one sided and two sided tests Theres one more thing I want to point out about the hypothesis test that Ive just constructed. If we take a moment to think about the statistical hypotheses Ive been using, \\[ \\begin{array}{cc} H_0 : &amp; \\theta = .5 \\\\ H_1 : &amp; \\theta \\neq .5 \\end{array} \\] we notice that the alternative hypothesis covers both the possibility that \\(\\theta &lt; .5\\) and the possibility that \\(\\theta &gt; .5\\). This makes sense if I really think that ESP could produce either better-than-chance performance or worse-than-chance performance (and there are some people who think that). In statistical language this is an example of a two-sided test. Its called this because the alternative hypothesis covers the area on both sides of the null hypothesis, and as a consequence the critical region of the test covers both tails of the sampling distribution (2.5% on either side if \\(\\alpha =.05\\)), as illustrated earlier in Figure 9.2. However, thats not the only possibility. I might only be willing to believe in ESP if it produces better than chance performance. If so, then my alternative hypothesis would only covers the possibility that \\(\\theta &gt; .5\\), and as a consequence the null hypothesis now becomes \\(\\theta \\leq .5\\) \\[ \\begin{array}{cc} H_0 : &amp; \\theta \\leq .5 \\\\ H_1 : &amp; \\theta &gt; .5 \\end{array} \\] When this happens, we have whats called a one-sided test and the critical region only covers one tail of the sampling distribution. This is illustrated in Figure 9.3. Figure 9.3: The critical region for a one sided test. In this case, the alternative hypothesis is that \\(\\theta &gt; .5\\) so we would only reject the null hypothesis for large values of \\(X\\). As a consequence, the critical region only covers the upper tail of the sampling distribution, specifically the upper 5% of the distribution. Contrast this to the two-sided version in Figure 9.2. 9.5 The \\(p\\) value of a test In one sense, our hypothesis test is complete. Weve constructed a test statistic, figured out its sampling distribution if the null hypothesis is true, and then constructed the critical region for the test. Nevertheless, Ive actually omitted the most important number of all, the \\(p\\) value. It is to this topic that we now turn. There are two somewhat different ways of interpreting a \\(p\\) value, one proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher and the other by Jerzy Neyman. Both versions are legitimate, though they reflect very different ways of thinking about hypothesis tests. Most introductory textbooks tend to give Fishers version only, but I think thats a bit of a shame. To my mind, Neymans version is cleaner and actually better reflects the logic of the null hypothesis test. You might disagree though, so Ive included both. Ill start with Neymans version. 9.5.1 A softer view of decision making One problem with the hypothesis testing procedure that Ive described is that it makes no distinction at all between a result that is barely significant and those that are highly significant. For instance, in my ESP study the data I obtained only just fell inside the critical region, so I did get a significant effect but it was a pretty near thing. In contrast, suppose that Id run a study in which \\(X=97\\) out of my \\(N=100\\) participants got the answer right. This would obviously be significant too but by a much larger margin, such that theres really no ambiguity about this at all. The procedure that I have already described makes no distinction between the two. If I adopt the standard convention of allowing \\(\\alpha = .05\\) as my acceptable Type I error rate, then both of these are significant results. This is where the \\(p\\) value comes in handy. To understand how it works, lets suppose that we ran lots of hypothesis tests on the same data set, but with a different value of \\(\\alpha\\) in each case. When we do that for my original ESP data what wed get is something like this Value of \\(\\alpha\\) Reject the null? 0.05 Yes 0.04 Yes 0.03 Yes 0.02 No 0.01 No When we test the ESP data (\\(X=62\\) successes out of \\(N=100\\) observations), using \\(\\alpha\\) levels of .03 and above, wed always find ourselves rejecting the null hypothesis. For \\(\\alpha\\) levels of .02 and below we always end up retaining the null hypothesis. Therefore, somewhere between .02 and .03 there must be a smallest value of \\(\\alpha\\) that would allow us to reject the null hypothesis for this data. This is the \\(p\\) value. As it turns out the ESP data has \\(p = .021\\). In short, \\(p\\) is defined to be the smallest Type I error rate (\\(\\alpha\\)) that you have to be willing to tolerate if you want to reject the null hypothesis. If it turns out that \\(p\\) describes an error rate that you find intolerable, then you must retain the null. If youre comfortable with an error rate equal to \\(p\\), then its okay to reject the null hypothesis in favour of your preferred alternative. In effect, \\(p\\) is a summary of all the possible hypothesis tests that you could have run, taken across all possible \\(\\alpha\\) values. And as a consequence it has the effect of softening our decision process. For those tests in which \\(p \\leq \\alpha\\) you would have rejected the null hypothesis, whereas for those tests in which \\(p &gt; \\alpha\\) you would have retained the null. In my ESP study I obtained \\(X=62\\) and as a consequence Ive ended up with \\(p = .021\\). So the error rate I have to tolerate is 2.1%. In contrast, suppose my experiment had yielded \\(X=97\\). What happens to my \\(p\\) value now? This time its shrunk to \\(p = 1.36 \\times 10^{-25}\\), which is a tiny, tiny56 Type I error rate. For this second case I would be able to reject the null hypothesis with a lot more confidence, because I only have to be willing to tolerate a type I error rate of about 1 in 10 trillion trillion in order to justify my decision to reject. 9.5.2 The probability of extreme data The second definition of the \\(p\\)-value comes from Sir Ronald Fisher, and its actually this one that you tend to see in most introductory statistics textbooks. Notice how, when I constructed the critical region, it corresponded to the tails (i.e., extreme values) of the sampling distribution? Thats not a coincidence, almost all good tests have this characteristic (good in the sense of minimising our type II error rate, \\(\\beta\\)). The reason for that is that a good critical region almost always corresponds to those values of the test statistic that are least likely to be observed if the null hypothesis is true. If this rule is true, then we can define the \\(p\\)-value as the probability that we would have observed a test statistic that is at least as extreme as the one we actually did get. In other words, if the data are extremely implausible according to the null hypothesis, then the null hypothesis is probably wrong. 9.5.3 A common mistake Okay, so you can see that there are two rather different but legitimate ways to interpret the \\(p\\) value, one based on Neymans approach to hypothesis testing and the other based on Fishers. Unfortunately, there is a third explanation that people sometimes give, especially when theyre first learning statistics, and it is absolutely and completely wrong. This mistaken approach is to refer to the \\(p\\) value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Its an intuitively appealing way to think, but its wrong in two key respects. First, null hypothesis testing is a frequentist tool and the frequentist approach to probability does not allow you to assign probabilities to the null hypothesis. According to this view of probability, the null hypothesis is either true or it is not, it cannot have a 5% chance of being true. Second, even within the Bayesian approach, which does let you assign probabilities to hypotheses, the \\(p\\) value would not correspond to the probability that the null is true. This interpretation is entirely inconsistent with the mathematics of how the \\(p\\) value is calculated. Put bluntly, despite the intuitive appeal of thinking this way, there is no justification for interpreting a \\(p\\) value this way. Never do it. 9.6 Reporting the results of a hypothesis test When writing up the results of a hypothesis test theres usually several pieces of information that you need to report, but it varies a fair bit from test to test. Throughout the rest of the book Ill spend a little time talking about how to report the results of different tests (see Section 10.1.9 for a particularly detailed example), so that you can get a feel for how its usually done. However, regardless of what test youre doing, the one thing that you always have to do is say something about the \\(p\\) value and whether or not the outcome was significant. The fact that you have to do this is unsurprising, its the whole point of doing the test. What might be surprising is the fact that there is some contention over exactly how youre supposed to do it. Leaving aside those people who completely disagree with the entire framework underpinning null hypothesis testing, theres a certain amount of tension that exists regarding whether or not to report the exact \\(p\\) value that you obtained, or if you should state only that \\(p &lt; \\alpha\\) for a significance level that you chose in advance (e.g., \\(p&lt;.05\\)). 9.6.1 The issue To see why this is an issue, the key thing to recognise is that \\(p\\) values are terribly convenient. In practice, the fact that we can compute a \\(p\\) value means that we dont actually have to specify any \\(\\alpha\\) level at all in order to run the test. Instead, what you can do is calculate your \\(p\\) value and interpret it directly. If you get \\(p = .062\\), then it means that youd have to be willing to tolerate a Type I error rate of 6.2% to justify rejecting the null. If you personally find 6.2% intolerable then you retain the null. Therefore, the argument goes, why dont we just report the actual \\(p\\) value and let the reader make up their own minds about what an acceptable Type I error rate is? This approach has the big advantage of softening the decision making process. In fact, if you accept the Neyman definition of the \\(p\\) value, thats the whole point of the \\(p\\) value. We no longer have a fixed significance level of \\(\\alpha = .05\\) as a bright line separating accept from reject decisions, and this removes the rather pathological problem of being forced to treat \\(p = .051\\) in a fundamentally different way to \\(p = .049\\). This flexibility is both the advantage and the disadvantage to the \\(p\\) value. The reason why a lot of people dont like the idea of reporting an exact \\(p\\) value is that it gives the researcher a bit too much freedom. In particular, it lets you change your mind about what error tolerance youre willing to put up with after you look at the data. For instance, consider my ESP experiment. Suppose I ran my test and ended up with a \\(p\\) value of .09. Should I accept or reject? Now, to be honest, I havent yet bothered to think about what level of Type I error Im really willing to accept. I dont have an opinion on that topic. But I do have an opinion about whether or not ESP exists, and I definitely have an opinion about whether my research should be published in a reputable scientific journal. And amazingly, now that Ive looked at the data Im starting to think that a 9% error rate isnt so bad, especially when compared to how annoying it would be to have to admit to the world that my experiment has failed. So, to avoid looking like I just made it up after the fact, I now say that my \\(\\alpha\\) is .1, with the argument that a 10% type I error rate isnt too bad and at that level my test is significant! I win. In other words, the worry here is that I might have the best of intentions, and be the most honest of people, but the temptation to just shade things a little bit here and there is really, really strong. As anyone who has ever run an experiment can attest, its a long and difficult process and you often get very attached to your hypotheses. Its hard to let go and admit the experiment didnt find what you wanted it to find. And thats the danger here. If we use the raw \\(p\\)-value, people will start interpreting the data in terms of what they want to believe, not what the data are actually saying and, if we allow that, why are we even bothering to do science at all? Why not let everyone believe whatever they like about anything, regardless of what the facts are? Okay, thats a bit extreme, but thats where the worry comes from. According to this view, you really must specify your \\(\\alpha\\) value in advance and then only report whether the test was significant or not. Its the only way to keep ourselves honest. 9.6.2 Two proposed solutions In practice, its pretty rare for a researcher to specify a single \\(\\alpha\\) level ahead of time. Instead, the convention is that scientists rely on three standard significance levels: .05, .01 and .001. When reporting your results, you indicate which (if any) of these significance levels allow you to reject the null hypothesis. This is summarised in Table 9.1. This allows us to soften the decision rule a little bit, since \\(p&lt;.01\\) implies that the data meet a stronger evidential standard than \\(p&lt;.05\\) would. Nevertheless, since these levels are fixed in advance by convention, it does prevent people choosing their \\(\\alpha\\) level after looking at the data. Table 9.1: A commonly adopted convention for reporting \\(p\\) values: in many places it is conventional to report one of four different things (e.g., \\(p&lt;.05\\)) as shown below. Ive included the significance stars notation (i.e., a * indicates \\(p&lt;.05\\)) because you sometimes see this notation produced by statistical software. Its also worth noting that some people will write n.s. (not significant) rather than \\(p&gt;.05\\). Usual notation Signif stars English Translation The null is \\(p&gt;.05\\) NA The test wasnt significant Retained \\(p&lt;.05\\) * The test was significant at \\(\\alpha\\) = .05 but not at \\(\\alpha =.01\\) or \\(\\alpha = .001\\) Rejected \\(p&lt;.01\\) ** The test was significant at \\(\\alpha\\) = .05 and \\(\\alpha = .01\\) but not at \\(\\alpha = .001\\) Rejected \\(p&lt;.001\\) *** The test was significant at all levels Rejected Nevertheless, quite a lot of people still prefer to report exact \\(p\\) values. To many people, the advantage of allowing the reader to make up their own mind about how to interpret \\(p = .06\\) outweighs any disadvantages. In practice, however, even among those researchers who prefer exact \\(p\\) values it is quite common to just write \\(p&lt;.001\\) instead of reporting an exact value for small \\(p\\). This is in part because a lot of software doesnt actually print out the \\(p\\) value when its that small (e.g., SPSS just writes \\(p = .000\\) whenever \\(p&lt;.001\\)), and in part because a very small \\(p\\) value can be kind of misleading. The human mind sees a number like .0000000001 and its hard to suppress the gut feeling that the evidence in favour of the alternative hypothesis is a near certainty. In practice however, this is usually wrong. Life is a big, messy, complicated thing, and every statistical test ever invented relies on simplifications, approximations and assumptions. As a consequence, its probably not reasonable to walk away from any statistical analysis with a feeling of confidence stronger than \\(p&lt;.001\\) implies. In other words, \\(p&lt;.001\\) is really code for as far as this test is concerned, the evidence is overwhelming. In light of all this, you might be wondering exactly what you should do. Theres a fair bit of contradictory advice on the topic, with some people arguing that you should report the exact \\(p\\) value, and other people arguing that you should use the tiered approach illustrated in Table 9.1. As a result, the best advice I can give is to suggest that you look at papers/reports written in your field and see what the convention seems to be. If there doesnt seem to be any consistent pattern, then use whichever method you prefer. 9.7 Running the hypothesis test in practice At this point some of you might be wondering if this is a real hypothesis test, or just a toy example that I made up. Its real. In the previous discussion I built the test from first principles, thinking that it was the simplest possible problem that you might ever encounter in real life. However, this test already exists. Its called the binomial test, and its implemented by jamovi as one of the statistical analyses available when you hit the Frequencies button. To test the null hypothesis that the response probability is one-half p = .5,57 and using data in which x = 62 of n = 100 people made the correct response, available in the binomialtest.omv data file, we get the results shown in Figure 9.4. Figure 9.4: Binomial test analysis and results in jamovi Right now, this output looks pretty unfamiliar to you, but you can see that its telling you more or less the right things. Specifically, the \\(p\\)-value of 0.02 is less than the usual choice of \\(\\alpha = .05\\), so you can reject the null. Well talk a lot more about how to read this sort of output as we go along, and after a while youll hopefully find it quite easy to read and understand. 9.8 Effect size, sample size and power In previous sections Ive emphasised the fact that the major design principle behind statistical hypothesis testing is that we try to control our Type I error rate. When we fix \\(\\alpha = .05\\) we are attempting to ensure that only 5% of true null hypotheses are incorrectly rejected. However, this doesnt mean that we dont care about Type II errors. In fact, from the researchers perspective, the error of failing to reject the null when it is actually false is an extremely annoying one. With that in mind, a secondary goal of hypothesis testing is to try to minimise \\(\\beta\\), the Type II error rate, although we dont usually talk in terms of minimising Type II errors. Instead, we talk about maximising the power of the test. Since power is defined as \\(1-\\beta\\), this is the same thing. 9.8.1 The power function Lets take a moment to think about what a Type II error actually is. A Type II error occurs when the alternative hypothesis is true, but we are nevertheless unable to reject the null hypothesis. Ideally, wed be able to calculate a single number \\(\\beta\\) that tells us the Type II error rate, in the same way that we can set \\(\\alpha = .05\\) for the Type I error rate. Unfortunately, this is a lot trickier to do. To see this, notice that in my ESP study the alternative hypothesis actually corresponds to lots of possible values of \\(\\theta\\). In fact, the alternative hypothesis corresponds to every value of \\(\\theta\\) except 0.5. Lets suppose that the true probability of someone choosing the correct response is 55% (i.e., \\(\\theta = .55\\)). If so, then the true sampling distribution for \\(X\\) is not the same one that the null hypothesis predicts, as the most likely value for \\(X\\) is now 55 out of 100. Not only that, the whole sampling distribution has now shifted, as shown in Figure 9.5. Figure 9.5: Sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis for a population parameter value of \\(\\theta = 0.55\\). A reasonable proportion of the distribution lies in the rejection region. The critical regions, of course, do not change. By definition the critical regions are based on what the null hypothesis predicts. What were seeing in this figure is the fact that when the null hypothesis is wrong, a much larger proportion of the sampling distribution distribution falls in the critical region. And of course thats what should happen. The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis is larger when the null hypothesis is actually false! However \\(\\theta = .55\\) is not the only possibility consistent with the alternative hypothesis. Lets instead suppose that the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is actually 0.7. What happens to the sampling distribution when this occurs? The answer, shown in Figure 9.6, is that almost the entirety of the sampling distribution has now moved into the critical region. Therefore, if \\(\\theta = 0.7\\), the probability of us correctly rejecting the null hypothesis (i.e., the power of the test) is much larger than if \\(\\theta = 0.55\\). In short, while \\(\\theta = .55\\) and \\(\\theta = .70\\) are both part of the alternative hypothesis, the Type II error rate is different. Figure 9.6: Sampling distribution under the alternative hypothesis for a population parameter value of \\(\\theta = 0.70\\). Almost all of the distribution lies in the rejection region. What all this means is that the power of a test (i.e., \\(1-\\beta\\)) depends on the true value of \\(\\theta\\). To illustrate this, Ive calculated the expected probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for all values of \\(\\theta\\), and plotted it in Figure 9.7. This plot describes what is usually called the power function of the test. Its a nice summary of how good the test is, because it actually tells you the power (\\(1-\\beta\\)) for all possible values of \\(\\theta\\). As you can see, when the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is very close to 0.5, the power of the test drops very sharply, but when it is further away, the power is large. Figure 9.7: The probability that we will reject the null hypothesis, plotted as a function of the true value of \\(\\theta\\). Obviously, the test is more powerful (greater chance of correct rejection) if the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is very different from the value that the null hypothesis specifies (i.e., \\(\\theta=.5\\)). Notice that when \\(\\theta\\) actually is equal to .5 (plotted as a black dot), the null hypothesis is in fact true and rejecting the null hypothesis in this instance would be a Type I error. 9.8.2 Effect size Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned with mice when there are tigers abroad  George Box (p.~792 Box 1976) The plot shown in Figure 9.7 captures a fairly basic point about hypothesis testing. If the true state of the world is very different from what the null hypothesis predicts then your power will be very high, but if the true state of the world is similar to the null (but not identical) then the power of the test is going to be very low. Therefore, its useful to be able to have some way of quantifying how similar the true state of the world is to the null hypothesis. A statistic that does this is called a measure of effect size (e.g. Cohen 1988; Ellis 2010). Effect size is defined slightly differently in different contexts (and so this section just talks in general terms) but the qualitative idea that it tries to capture is always the same. How big is the difference between the true population parameters and the parameter values that are assumed by the null hypothesis? In our ESP example, if we let \\(\\theta_0 = 0.5\\) denote the value assumed by the null hypothesis and let \\(\\theta\\) denote the true value, then a simple measure of effect size could be something like the difference between the true value and null (i.e., \\(\\theta - \\theta_0\\)), or possibly just the magnitude of this difference, \\(\\mbox{abs}(\\theta - \\theta_0)\\). Table 9.2: A crude guide to understanding the relationship between statistical significance and effect sizes. Basically, if you dont have a significant result then the effect size is pretty meaningless because you dont have any evidence that its even real. On the other hand, if you do have a significant effect but your effect size is small then theres a pretty good chance that your result (although real) isnt all that interesting. However, this guide is very crude. It depends a lot on what exactly youre studying. Small effects can be of massive practical importance in some situations. So dont take this table too seriously. Its a rough guide at best. big effect size small effect size significant result difference is real, and of practical importance difference is real, but might not be interesting non-significant result no effect observed no effect observed Why calculate effect size? Lets assume that youve run your experiment, collected the data, and gotten a significant effect when you ran your hypothesis test. Isnt it enough just to say that youve gotten a significant effect? Surely thats the point of hypothesis testing? Well, sort of. Yes, the point of doing a hypothesis test is to try to demonstrate that the null hypothesis is wrong, but thats hardly the only thing were interested in. If the null hypothesis claimed that \\(\\theta = .5\\) and we show that its wrong, weve only really told half of the story. Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that we believe that \\(\\theta \\neq .5\\), but theres a big difference between \\(\\theta = .51\\) and \\(\\theta = .8\\). If we find that \\(\\theta = .8\\), then not only have we found that the null hypothesis is wrong, it appears to be very wrong. On the other hand, suppose weve successfully rejected the null hypothesis, but it looks like the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is only .51 (this would only be possible with a very large study). Sure, the null hypothesis is wrong but its not at all clear that we actually care because the effect size is so small. In the context of my ESP study we might still care since any demonstration of real psychic powers would actually be pretty cool58, but in other contexts a 1% difference usually isnt very interesting, even if it is a real difference. For instance, suppose were looking at differences in high school exam scores between males and females and it turns out that the female scores are 1% higher on average than the males. If Ive got data from thousands of students then this difference will almost certainly be *statistically significant], but regardless of how small the \\(p\\) value is its just not very interesting. Youd hardly want to go around proclaiming a crisis in boys education on the basis of such a tiny difference would you? Its for this reason that it is becoming more standard (slowly, but surely) to report some kind of standard measure of effect size along with the the results of the hypothesis test. The hypothesis test itself tells you whether you should believe that the effect you have observed is real (i.e., not just due to chance), whereas the effect size tells you whether or not you should care. 9.8.3 Increasing the power of your study Not surprisingly, scientists are fairly obsessed with maximising the power of their experiments. We want our experiments to work and so we want to maximise the chance of rejecting the null hypothesis if it is false (and of course we usually want to believe that it is false!). As weve seen, one factor that influences power is the effect size. So the first thing you can do to increase your power is to increase the effect size. In practice, what this means is that you want to design your study in such a way that the effect size gets magnified. For instance, in my ESP study I might believe that psychic powers work best in a quiet, darkened room with fewer distractions to cloud the mind. Therefore I would try to conduct my experiments in just such an environment. If I can strengthen peoples ESP abilities somehow then the true value of \\(\\theta\\) will go up59 and therefore my effect size will be larger. In short, clever experimental design is one way to boost power, because it can alter the effect size. Unfortunately, its often the case that even with the best of experimental designs you may have only a small effect. Perhaps, for example, ESP really does exist but even under the best of conditions its very very weak. Under those circumstances your best bet for increasing power is to increase the sample size. In general, the more observations that you have available, the more likely it is that you can discriminate between two hypotheses. If I ran my ESP experiment with 10 participants and 7 of them correctly guessed the colour of the hidden card you wouldnt be terribly impressed. But if I ran it with 10,000 participants, and 7,000 of them got the answer right, you would be much more likely to think I had discovered something. In other words, power increases with the sample size. This is illustrated in Figure 9.8, which shows the power of the test for a true parameter of \\(\\theta = 0.7\\) for all sample sizes \\(N\\) from 1 to 100, where Im assuming that the null hypothesis predicts that \\(\\theta_0 = 0.5\\). Figure 9.8: The power of our test plotted as a function of the sample size \\(N\\). In this case, the true value of \\(\\theta\\) is 0.7 but the null hypothesis is that \\(\\theta = 0.5\\). Overall, larger \\(N\\) means greater power. (The small zig-zags in this function occur because of some odd interactions between \\(\\theta\\), \\(\\alpha\\) and the fact that the binomial distribution is discrete, it doesnt matter for any serious purpose). Because power is important, whenever youre contemplating running an experiment it would be pretty useful to know how much power youre likely to have. Its never possible to know for sure since you cant possibly know what your real effect size is. However, its often (well, sometimes) possible to guess how big it should be. If so, you can guess what sample size you need! This idea is called power analysis, and if its feasible to do it then its very helpful. It can tell you something about whether you have enough time or money to be able to run the experiment successfully. Its increasingly common to see people arguing that power analysis should be a required part of experimental design, so its worth knowing about. I dont discuss power analysis in this book, however. This is partly for a boring reason and partly for a substantive one. The boring reason is that I havent had time to write about power analysis yet. The substantive one is that Im still a little suspicious of power analysis. Speaking as a researcher, I have very rarely found myself in a position to be able to do one. Its either the case that (a) my experiment is a bit non-standard and I dont know how to define effect size properly, or (b) I literally have so little idea about what the effect size will be that I wouldnt know how to interpret the answers. Not only that, after extensive conversations with someone who does stats consulting for a living (my wife, as it happens), I cant help but notice that in practice the only time anyone ever asks her for a power analysis is when shes helping someone write a grant application. In other words, the only time any scientist ever seems to want a power analysis in real life is when theyre being forced to do it by bureaucratic process. Its not part of anyones day to day work. In short, Ive always been of the view that whilst power is an important concept, power *analysis is not as useful as people make it sound, except in the rare cases where (a) someone has figured out how to calculate power for your actual experimental design and (b) you have a pretty good idea what the effect size is likely to be.60 Maybe other people have had better experiences than me, but Ive personally never been in a situation where both (a) and (b) were true. Maybe Ill be convinced otherwise in the future, and probably a future version of this book would include a more detailed discussion of power analysis, but for now this is about as much as Im comfortable saying about the topic. 9.9 Some issues to consider What Ive described to you in this chapter is the orthodox framework for null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). Understanding how NHST works is an absolute necessity because it has been the dominant approach to inferential statistics ever since it came to prominence in the early 20th century. Its what the vast majority of working scientists rely on for their data analysis, so even if you hate it you need to know it. However, the approach is not without problems. There are a number of quirks in the framework, historical oddities in how it came to be, theoretical disputes over whether or not the framework is right, and a lot of practical traps for the unwary. Im not going to go into a lot of detail on this topic, but I think its worth briefly discussing a few of these issues. 9.9.1 Neyman versus Fisher The first thing you should be aware of is that orthodox NHST is actually a mash-up of two rather different approaches to hypothesis testing, one proposed by Sir Ronald Fisher and the other proposed by Jerzy Neyman (for a historical summary Lehmann 2011). The history is messy because Fisher and Neyman were real people whose opinions changed over time, and at no point did either of them offer the definitive statement of how we should interpret their work many decades later. That said, heres a quick summary of what I take these two approaches to be. First, lets talk about Fishers approach. As far as I can tell, Fisher assumed that you only had the one hypothesis (the null) and that what you want to do is find out if the null hypothesis is inconsistent with the data. From his perspective, what you should do is check to see if the data are sufficiently unlikely according to the null. In fact, if you remember back to our earlier discussion, thats how Fisher defines the \\(p\\)-value. According to Fisher, if the null hypothesis provided a very poor account of the data then you could safely reject it. But, since you dont have any other hypotheses to compare it to, theres no way of accepting the alternative because you dont necessarily have an explicitly stated alternative. Thats more or less all there is to it. In contrast, Neyman thought that the point of hypothesis testing was as a guide to action and his approach was somewhat more formal than Fishers. His view was that there are multiple things that you could do (accept the null or accept the alternative) and the point of the test was to tell you which one the data support. From this perspective, it is critical to specify your alternative hypothesis properly. If you dont know what the alternative hypothesis is, then you dont know how powerful the test is, or even which action makes sense. His framework genuinely requires a competition between different hypotheses. For Neyman, the \\(p\\) value didnt directly measure the probability of the data (or data more extreme) under the null, it was more of an abstract description about which possible tests were telling you to accept the null, and which possible tests were telling you to accept the alternative. As you can see, what we have today is an odd mishmash of the two. We talk about having both a null hypothesis and an alternative (Neyman), but usually61 define the \\(p\\) value in terms of extreme data (Fisher), but we still have \\(\\alpha\\) values (Neyman). Some of the statistical tests have explicitly specified alternatives (Neyman) but others are quite vague about it (Fisher). And, according to some people at least, were not allowed to talk about accepting the alternative (Fisher). Its a mess, but I hope this at least explains why its a mess. 9.9.2 Bayesians versus frequentists Earlier on in this chapter I was quite emphatic about the fact that you cannot interpret the \\(p\\) value as the probability that the null hypothesis is true. NHST is fundamentally a frequentist tool (see Chapter 7) and as such it does not allow you to assign probabilities to hypotheses. The null hypothesis is either true or it is not. The Bayesian approach to statistics interprets probability as a degree of belief, so its totally okay to say that there is a 10% chance that the null hypothesis is true. Thats just a reflection of the degree of confidence that you have in this hypothesis. You arent allowed to do this within the frequentist approach. Remember, if youre a frequentist, a probability can only be defined in terms of what happens after a large number of independent replications (i.e., a long run frequency). If this is your interpretation of probability, talking about the probability that the null hypothesis is true is complete gibberish: a null hypothesis is either true or it is false. Theres no way you can talk about a long run frequency for this statement. To talk about the probability of the null hypothesis is as meaningless as the colour of freedom. It doesnt have one! Most importantly, this isnt a purely ideological matter. If you decide that you are a Bayesian and that youre okay with making probability statements about hypotheses, you have to follow the Bayesian rules for calculating those probabilities. Ill talk more about this in Chapter ??, but for now what I want to point out to you is the \\(p\\) value is a terrible approximation to the probability that \\(H_0\\) is true. If what you want to know is the probability of the null, then the \\(p\\) value is not what youre looking for! 9.9.3 Traps As you can see, the theory behind hypothesis testing is a mess, and even now there are arguments in statistics about how it should work. However, disagreements among statisticians are not our real concern here. Our real concern is practical data analysis. And while the orthodox approach to null hypothesis significance testing has many drawbacks, even an unrepentant Bayesian like myself would agree that they can be useful if used responsibly. Most of the time they give sensible answers and you can use them to learn interesting things. Setting aside the various ideologies and historical confusions that weve discussed, the fact remains that the biggest danger in all of statistics is thoughtlessness. I dont mean stupidity, I literally mean thoughtlessness. The rush to interpret a result without spending time thinking through what each test actually says about the data, and checking whether thats consistent with how youve interpreted it. Thats where the biggest trap lies. To give an example of this, consider the following example (see A. Gelman and Stern 2006). Suppose Im running my ESP study and Ive decided to analyse the data separately for the male participants and the female participants. Of the male participants, 33 out of 50 guessed the colour of the card correctly. This is a significant effect (\\(p = .03\\)). Of the female participants, 29 out of 50 guessed correctly. This is not a significant effect (\\(p = .32\\)). Upon observing this, it is extremely tempting for people to start wondering why there is a difference between males and females in terms of their psychic abilities. However, this is wrong. If you think about it, we havent actually run a test that explicitly compares males to females. All we have done is compare males to chance (binomial test was significant) and compared females to chance (binomial test was non significant). If we want to argue that there is a real difference between the males and the females, we should probably run a test of the null hypothesis that there is no difference! We can do that using a different hypothesis test,62 but when we do that it turns out that we have no evidence that males and females are significantly different (\\(p = .54\\)). Now do you think that theres anything fundamentally different between the two groups? Of course not. Whats happened here is that the data from both groups (male and female) are pretty borderline. By pure chance one of them happened to end up on the magic side of the \\(p = .05\\) line, and the other one didnt. That doesnt actually imply that males and females are different. This mistake is so common that you should always be wary of it. The difference between significant and not-significant is not evidence of a real difference. If you want to say that theres a difference between two groups, then you have to test for that difference! The example above is just that, an example. Ive singled it out because its such a common one, but the bigger picture is that data analysis can be tricky to get right. Think about what it is you want to test, why you want to test it, and whether or not the answers that your test gives could possibly make any sense in the real world. 9.10 Summary Null hypothesis testing is one of the most ubiquitous elements to statistical theory. The vast majority of scientific papers report the results of some hypothesis test or another. As a consequence it is almost impossible to get by in science without having at least a cursory understanding of what a \\(p\\)-value means, making this one of the most important chapters in the book. As usual, Ill end the chapter with a quick recap of the key ideas that weve talked about: Research hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. Null and alternative hypotheses. (Section 9.1). Type 1 and Type 2 errors (Section 9.2) Test statistics and sampling distributions (Section 9.3) Hypothesis testing as a decision making process (Section 9.4) \\(p\\)-values as soft decisions (Section 9.5) Writing up the results of a hypothesis test (Section 9.6) Running the hypothesis test in practice (Section 9.7) Effect size and power (Section 9.8) A few issues to consider regarding hypothesis testing (Section 9.9) Later in the book, in Chapter ??, Ill revisit the theory of null hypothesis tests from a Bayesian perspective and introduce a number of new tools that you can use if you arent particularly fond of the orthodox approach. But for now, though, were done with the abstract statistical theory, and we can start discussing specific data analysis tools.

So where should we start? Not every textbook agrees on where to start, but Im going to start with \\(\\chi^2\\) tests (this chapter, pronounced chi-square63) and \\(t\\)-tests (Chapter ??). Both of these tools are very frequently used in scientific practice, and whilst theyre not as powerful as regression (Chapter ??) and analysis of variance (Chapter ??) theyre much easier to understand. The term categorical data is just another name for nominal scale data. Its nothing that we havent already discussed, its just that in the context of data analysis people tend to use the term categorical data rather than nominal scale data. I dont know why. In any case, categorical data analysis refers to a collection of tools that you can use when your data are nominal scale. However, there are a lot of different tools that can be used for categorical data analysis, and this chapter covers only a few of the more common ones. 10.1 The \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test The \\(\\chi^2\\) goodness-of-fit test is one of the oldest hypothesis tests around. It was invented by Karl Pearson around the turn of the century (Pearson 1900), with some corrections made later by Sir Ronald Fisher (Fisher 1922a). It tests whether an observed frequency distribution of a nominal variable matches an expected frequency distribution. For example, suppose a group of patients has been undergoing an experimental treatment and have had their health assessed to see whether their condition has improved, stayed the same or worsened. A goodness-of-fit test could be used to determine whether the numbers in each category - improved, no change, worsened - match the numbers that would be expected given the standard treatment option. Lets think about this some more, with some psychology. 10.1.1 The cards data Over the years there have been many studies showing that humans find it difficult to simulate randomness. Try as we might to act random, we think in terms of patterns and structure and so, when asked to do something at random, what people actually do is anything but random. As a consequence, the study of human randomness (or non-randomness, as the case may be) opens up a lot of deep psychological questions about how we think about the world. With this in mind, lets consider a very simple study. Suppose I asked people to imagine a shuffled deck of cards, and mentally pick one card from this imaginary deck at random. After theyve chosen one card I ask them to mentally select a second one. For both choices what were going to look at is the suit (hearts, clubs, spades or diamonds) that people chose. After asking, say, \\(N=200\\) people to do this, Id like to look at the data and figure out whether or not the cards that people pretended to select were really random. The data are contained in the randomness.csv file in which, when you open it up in jamovi and take a look at the spreadsheet view, you will see three variables. These are: an id variable that assigns a unique identifier to each participant, and the two variables #choice_1# and #choice_2# that indicate the card suits that people chose. For the moment, lets just focus on the first choice that people made. Well use the Frequency tables option under Exploration - Descriptives to count the number of times that we observed people choosing each suit. This is what we get: clubs diamonds hearts spades 35 51 64 50 That little frequency table is quite helpful. Looking at it, theres a bit of a hint that people might be more likely to select hearts than clubs, but its not completely obvious just from looking at it whether thats really true, or if this is just due to chance. So well probably have to do some kind of statistical analysis to find out, which is what Im going to talk about in the next section. Excellent. From this point on, well treat this table as the data that were looking to analyse. However, since Im going to have to talk about this data in mathematical terms (sorry!) it might be a good idea to be clear about what the notation is. In mathematical notation, we shorten the human-readable word observed to the letter \\(O\\), and we use subscripts to denote the position of the observation. So the second observation in our table is written as \\(O_2\\) in maths. The relationship between the English descriptions and the mathematical symbols are illustrated below: label index \\(i\\) math symbol the value clubs \\(\\clubsuit\\) 1 \\(O_1\\) 35 diamonds \\(\\diamondsuit\\) 2 \\(O_2\\) 51 hearts \\(\\heartsuit\\) 3 \\(O_3\\) 64 spades \\(\\spadesuit\\) 4 \\(O_4\\) 50 Hopefully thats pretty clear. Its also worth noting that mathematicians prefer to talk about general rather than specific things, so youll also see the notation \\(O_i\\), which refers to the number of observations that fall within the \\(i\\)-th category (where \\(i\\) could be 1, 2, 3 or 4). Finally, if we want to refer to the set of all observed frequencies, statisticians group all observed values into a vector64, which Ill refer to as \\(\\bm{O}\\). \\[ \\bm{O} = (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4) \\] Again, this is nothing new or interesting. Its just notation. If I say that \\(\\bm{O}~=~(35, 51, 64, 50)\\) all Im doing is describing the table of observed frequencies (i.e., observed), but Im referring to it using mathematical notation. 10.1.2 The null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis As the last section indicated, our research hypothesis is that people dont choose cards randomly. What were going to want to do now is translate this into some statistical hypotheses and then construct a statistical test of those hypotheses. The test that Im going to describe to you is Pearsons \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test, and as is so often the case we have to begin by carefully constructing our null hypothesis. In this case, its pretty easy. First, lets state the null hypothesis in words: \\(H_0\\) All four suits are chosen with equal probability Now, because this is statistics, we have to be able to say the same thing in a mathematical way. To do this, lets use the notation \\(P_j\\) to refer to the true probability that the \\(j\\)-th suit is chosen. If the null hypothesis is true, then each of the four suits has a 25% chance of being selected. In other words, our null hypothesis claims that \\(P_1 = .25\\), \\(P_2 = .25\\), \\(P_3 = .25\\) and finally that \\(P_4 = .25\\). However, in the same way that we can group our observed frequencies into a vector \\(\\bm{O}\\) that summarises the entire data set, we can use \\(\\bm{P}\\) to refer to the probabilities that correspond to our null hypothesis. So if I let the vector \\(\\bm{P} = (P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4)\\) refer to the collection of probabilities that describe our null hypothesis, then we have: \\[ H_0: {P} = (.25, .25, .25, .25) \\] In this particular instance, our null hypothesis corresponds to a vector of probabilities \\(\\bm{P}\\) in which all of the probabilities are equal to one another. But this doesnt have to be the case. For instance, if the experimental task was for people to imagine they were drawing from a deck that had twice as many clubs as any other suit, then the null hypothesis would correspond to something like \\(\\bm{P} = (.4, .2, .2, .2)\\). As long as the probabilities are all positive numbers, and they all sum to 1, then its a perfectly legitimate choice for the null hypothesis. However, the most common use of the goodness-of-fit test is to test a null hypothesis that all of the categories are equally likely, so well stick to that for our example. What about our alternative hypothesis, \\(H_1\\)? All were really interested in is demonstrating that the probabilities involved arent all identical (that is, peoples choices werent completely random). As a consequence, the human friendly versions of our hypotheses look like this: \\(H_0\\) \\(H_1\\) All four suits are chosen with equal probability At least one of the suit-choice probabilities isnt .25 and the mathematician friendly version is: \\(H_0\\) \\(H_1\\) \\(P = (.25, .25, .25, .25)\\) \\(P \\neq (.25,.25,.25,.25)\\) 10.1.3 The goodness-of-fit test statistic} At this point, we have our observed frequencies \\(\\bm{O}\\) and a collection of probabilities \\(\\bm{P}\\) corresponding to the null hypothesis that we want to test. What we now want to do is construct a test of the null hypothesis. As always, if we want to test \\(H_0\\) against \\(H_1\\), were going to need a test statistic. The basic trick that a goodness-of-fit test uses is to construct a test statistic that measures how close the data are to the null hypothesis. If the data dont resemble what youd expect to see if the null hypothesis were true, then it probably isnt true. Okay, if the null hypothesis were true, what would we expect to see? Or, to use the correct terminology, what are the expected frequencies. There are \\(N=200\\) observations, and (if the null is true) the probability of any one of them choosing a heart is \\(P_3 = .25\\), so I guess were expecting \\(200 \\times .25 = 50\\) hearts, right? Or, more specifically, if we let \\(E_i\\) refer to the number of category \\(i\\) responses that were expecting if the null is true, then \\[ E_i = N \\times P_i \\] This is pretty easy to calculate.If there are 200 observations that can fall into four categories, and we think that all four categories are equally likely, then on average wed expect to see 50 observations in each category, right? Now, how do we translate this into a test statistic? Clearly, what we want to do is compare the expected number of observations in each category (\\(E_i\\)) with the observed number of observations in that category (\\(O_i\\)). And on the basis of this comparison we ought to be able to come up with a good test statistic. To start with, lets calculate the difference between what the null hypothesis expected us to find and what we actually did find. That is, we calculate the observed minus expected difference score, \\(O_i - E_i\\). This is illustrated in the following table. \\(\\clubsuit\\) \\(\\diamondsuit\\) \\(\\heartsuit\\) \\(\\spadesuit\\) expected frequency \\(E_i\\) 50 50 50 50 observed frequency \\(O_i\\) 35 51 64 50 difference score \\(O_i - E_i\\) -15 1 14 0 So, based on our calculations, its clear that people chose more hearts and fewer clubs than the null hypothesis predicted. However, a moments thought suggests that these raw differences arent quite what were looking for. Intuitively, it feels like its just as bad when the null hypothesis predicts too few observations (which is what happened with hearts) as it is when it predicts too many (which is what happened with clubs). So its a bit weird that we have a negative number for clubs and a positive number for hearts. One easy way to fix this is to square everything, so that we now calculate the squared differences, \\((E_i - O_i)^2\\). As before, we can do this by hand: (observed - expected)^2 clubs diamonds hearts spades 225 1 196 0 Now were making progress. What weve got now is a collection of numbers that are big whenever the null hypothesis makes a bad prediction (clubs and hearts), but are small whenever it makes a good one (diamonds and spades). Next, for some technical reasons that Ill explain in a moment, lets also divide all these numbers by the expected frequency \\(E_i\\), so were actually calculating \\(\\frac{(E_i-O_i)^2}{E_i}\\). Since \\(E_i = 50\\) for all categories in our example, its not a very interesting calculation, but lets do it anyway: (observed - expected)^2 / expected clubs diamonds hearts spades 4.50 0.02 3.92 0.00 In effect, what weve got here are four different error scores, each one telling us how big a mistake the null hypothesis made when we tried to use it to predict our observed frequencies. So, in order to convert this into a useful test statistic, one thing we could do is just add these numbers up. The result is called the goodness-of-fit statistic, conventionally referred to either as \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) or GOF. We can calculate it as follows: sum( (observed - expected)^2 / expected ) This gives us a value of 8.44. If we let \\(k\\) refer to the total number of categories (i.e., \\(k=4\\) for our cards data), then the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is given by: \\[ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\] Intuitively, its clear that if \\(\\chi^2\\) is small, then the observed data \\(O_i\\) are very close to what the null hypothesis predicted \\(E_i\\), so were going to need a large \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic in order to reject the null. As weve seen from our calculations, in our cards data set weve got a value of \\(\\chi^2 = 8.44\\). So now the question becomes is this a big enough value to reject the null? 10.1.4 The sampling distribution of the GOF statistic To determine whether or not a particular value of \\(\\chi^2\\) is large enough to justify rejecting the null hypothesis, were going to need to figure out what the sampling distribution for \\(\\chi^2\\) would be if the null hypothesis were true. So thats what Im going to do in this section. Ill show you in a fair amount of detail how this sampling distribution is constructed, and then, in the next section, use it to build up a hypothesis test. If you want to cut to the chase and are willing to take it on faith that the sampling distribution is a \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom, you can skip the rest of this section. However, if you want to understand why the goodness-of-fit test works the way it does, read on. Okay, lets suppose that the null hypothesis is actually true. If so, then the true probability that an observation falls in the \\(i\\)-th category is \\(P_i\\). After all, thats pretty much the definition of our null hypothesis. Lets think about what this actually means. This is kind of like saying that nature makes the decision about whether or not the observation ends up in category \\(i\\) by flipping a weighted coin (i.e., one where the probability of getting a head is \\(P_j\\)). And therefore we can think of our observed frequency \\(O_i\\) by imagining that nature flipped \\(N\\) of these coins (one for each observation in the data set), and exactly \\(O_i\\) of them came up heads. Obviously, this is a pretty weird way to think about the experiment. But what it does (I hope) is remind you that weve actually seen this scenario before. Its exactly the same set up that gave rise to the binomial distribution in Section 7.4. In other words, if the null hypothesis is true, then it follows that our observed frequencies were generated by sampling from a binomial distribution: \\[ O_i \\sim \\mbox{Binomial}(P_i, N) \\] Now, if you remember from our discussion of the central limit theorem (Section 8.3.3 the binomial distribution starts to look pretty much identical to the normal distribution, especially when \\(N\\) is large and when \\(P_i\\) isnt too close to 0 or 1. In other words as long as \\(N \\times P_i\\) is large enough. Or, to put it another way, when the expected frequency \\(E_i\\) is large enough then the theoretical distribution of \\(O_i\\) is approximately normal. Better yet, if \\(O_i\\) is normally distributed, then so is \\((O_i - E_i)/\\sqrt{E_i}\\). Since \\(E_i\\) is a fixed value, subtracting off \\(E_i\\) and dividing by \\(\\sqrt{E_i}\\) changes the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution but thats all it does. Okay, so now lets have a look at what our goodness-of-fit statistic actually is. What were doing is taking a bunch of things that are normally-distributed, squaring them, and adding them up. Wait. Weve seen that before too! As we discussed in Section 7.6, when you take a bunch of things that have a standard normal distribution (i.e., mean 0 and standard deviation 1), square them and then add them up, the resulting quantity has a chi-square distribution. So now we know that the null hypothesis predicts that the sampling distribution of the goodness-of-fit statistic is a chi-square distribution. Cool. Theres one last detail to talk about, namely the degrees of freedom. If you remember back to Section 7.6, I said that if the number of things youre adding up is \\(k\\), then the degrees of freedom for the resulting chi-square distribution is \\(k\\). Yet, what I said at the start of this section is that the actual degrees of freedom for the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is \\(k-1\\). Whats up with that? The answer here is that what were supposed to be looking at is the number of genuinely independent things that are getting added together. And, as Ill go on to talk about in the next section, even though there are \\(k\\) things that were adding only \\(k-1\\) of them are truly independent, and so the degrees of freedom is actually only \\(k-1\\). Thats the topic of the next section.65 10.1.5 Degrees of freedom When I introduced the chi-square distribution in Section 7.6, I was a bit vague about what degrees of freedom actually means. Obviously, it matters. Looking at Figure ??, you can see that if we change the degrees of freedom then the chi-square distribution changes shape quite substantially. But what exactly is it? Again, when I introduced the distribution and explained its relationship to the normal distribution, I did offer an answer: its the number of normally distributed variables that Im squaring and adding together. But, for most people, thats kind of abstract and not entirely helpful. What we really need to do is try to understand degrees of freedom in terms of our data. So here goes. The basic idea behind degrees of freedom is quite simple. You calculate it by counting up the number of distinct \"quantities\" that are used to describe your data and then subtracting off all of the \"constraints\" that those data must satisfy. This is a bit vague, so lets use our cards data as a concrete example. We describe our data using four numbers, \\(O_1\\), \\(O_2\\), \\(O_3\\) and \\(O_4\\) corresponding to the observed frequencies of the four different categories (hearts, clubs, diamonds, spades). These four numbers are the random outcomes of our experiment. But my experiment actually has a fixed constraint built into it: the sample size \\(N\\). That is, if we know how many people chose hearts, how many chose diamonds and how many chose clubs, then wed be able to figure out exactly how many chose spades. In other words, although our data are described using four numbers, they only actually correspond to \\(4-1 = 3\\) degrees of freedom. A slightly different way of thinking about it is to notice that there are four probabilities that were interested in (again, corresponding to the four different categories), but these probabilities must sum to one, which imposes a constraint. Therefore the degrees of freedom is \\(4-1 = 3\\). Regardless of whether you want to think about it in terms of the observed frequencies or in terms of the probabilities, the answer is the same. In general, when running the \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test for an experiment involving \\(k\\) groups, then the degrees of freedom will be \\(k-1\\). 10.1.6 Testing the null hypothesis} The final step in the process of constructing our hypothesis test is to figure out what the rejection region is. That is, what values of \\(\\chi^2\\) would lead us to reject the null hypothesis. As we saw earlier, large values of \\(\\chi^2\\) imply that the null hypothesis has done a poor job of predicting the data from our experiment, whereas small values of \\(\\chi^2\\) imply that its actually done pretty well. Therefore, a pretty sensible strategy would be to say there is some critical value such that if \\(\\chi^2\\) is bigger than the critical value we reject the null, but if \\(\\chi^2\\) is smaller than this value we retain the null. In other words, to use the language we introduced in Chapter @ref(hypothesistesting} the chi-square goodness-of-fit test is always a one-sided test. Right, so all we have to do is figure out what this critical value is. And its pretty straightforward. If we want our test to have significance level of \\(\\alpha = .05\\) (that is, we are willing to tolerate a Type I error rate of 5%), then we have to choose our critical value so that there is only a 5% chance that \\(\\chi^2\\) could get to be that big if the null hypothesis is true. This is illustrated in Figure ??. Ah but, I hear you ask, how do I find the critical value of a chi-square distribution with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom? Many many years ago when I first took a psychology statistics class we used to look up these critical values in a book of critical value tables, like the one in Figure @ref(fig:chisquare.critvalues). Looking at this Figure, we can see that the critical value for a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with 3 degrees of freedom, and p=0.05 is 7.815. So, if our calculated \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is bigger than the critical value of 7.815, then we can reject the null hypothesis (remember that the null hypothesis, \\(H_0\\), is that all four suits are chosen with equal probability). Since we actually already calculated that before (i.e., \\(\\chi^2 = 8.44\\)) we can reject the null hypothesis. And thats it, basically. You now know Pearsons \\(\\chi^2\\) test for the goodness-of-fit. Lucky you. 10.1.7 Doing the test in jamovi Not surprisingly, jamovi provides an analysis that will do these calculations for you. From the main Analyses toolbar select Frequencies - One Sample Proportion Tests - N Outcomes. Then in the analysis window that appears move the variable you want to analyse (choice\\_1) across into the Variable box. Also, click on the Expected counts check box so that these are shown on the results table. When you have done all this, you should see the analysis results in jamovi as in Figure~. No surprise then that jamovi provides the same expected counts and statistics that we calculated by hand above, with a \\(\\chi^2\\) value of 8.44 with 3 d.f. and \\(p\\)=0.038. Note that we dont need to look up a critical p-value threshold value any more, as jamovi gives us the actual \\(p\\)-value of the calculated \\(\\chi^2\\) for 3 d.f. 10.1.8 Specifying a different null hypothesis At this point you might be wondering what to do if you want to run a goodness-of-fit test but your null hypothesis is not that all categories are equally likely. For instance, lets suppose that someone had made the theoretical prediction that people should choose red cards 60% of the time, and black cards 40% of the time (Ive no idea why youd predict that), but had no other preferences. If that were the case, the null hypothesis would be to expect 30% of the choices to be hearts, 30% to be diamonds, 20% to be spades and 20% to be clubs. In other words we would expect hearts and diamonds to appear 1.5 times more often than spades and clubs (the ratio 30% : 20% is the same as 1.5 : 1). This seems like a silly theory to me, and its pretty easy to test this explicitly specified null hypothesis with the data in our jamovi analysis. In the analysis window (labelled Proportion Test (N Outcomes)' in Figure~\\ref{fig:chisquare.analysis1} you can expand the options forExpected Proportions. When you do this, there are options for entering different ratio values for the variable you have selected, in our case this is `choice_1}. Change the ratio to reflect the new null hypothesis, as in Figure @ref(fig:chisquare.analysis2), and see how the results change. The expected counts are now: and the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is 4.74, 3 d.f., \\(p\\) = 0.182. Now, the results of our updated hypotheses and the expected frequencies are different from what they were last time. As a consequence our \\(\\chi^2\\) test statistic is different, and our \\(p\\)-value is different too. Annoyingly, the \\(p\\)-value is .182, so we cant reject the null hypothesis (look back at section to remind yourself why). Sadly, despite the fact that the null hypothesis corresponds to a very silly theory, these data dont provide enough evidence against it. 10.1.9 How to report the results of the test So now you know how the test works, and you know how to do the test using a wonderful jamovi flavoured magic computing box. The next thing you need to know is how to write up the results. After all, theres no point in designing and running an experiment and then analysing the data if you dont tell anyone about it! So lets now talk about what you need to do when reporting your analysis. Lets stick with our card-suits example. If I wanted to write this result up for a paper or something, then the conventional way to report this would be to write something like this: Of the 200 participants in the experiment, 64 selected hearts for their first choice, 51 selected diamonds, 50 selected spades, and 35 selected clubs. A chi-square goodness-of-fit test was conducted to test whether the choice probabilities were identical for all four suits. The results were significant (\\(\\chi^2(3) = 8.44, p&lt;.05\\)), suggesting that people did not select suits purely at random. This is pretty straightforward and hopefully it seems pretty unremarkable. That said, theres a few things that you should note about this description: {}. That is, I told the reader something about what the data look like before going on to do the test. In general, this is good practice. Always remember that your reader doesnt know your data anywhere near as well as you do. So, unless you describe it to them properly, the statistical tests wont make any sense to them and theyll get frustrated and cry. {}. To be honest, writers dont always do this but its often a good idea in those situations where some ambiguity exists, or when you cant rely on your readership being intimately familiar with the statistical tools that youre using. Quite often the reader might not know (or remember) all the details of the test that your using, so its a kind of politeness to remind them! As far as the goodness-of-fit test goes, you can usually rely on a scientific audience knowing how it works (since its covered in most intro stats classes). However, its still a good idea to be explicit about stating the null hypothesis (briefly!) because the null hypothesis can be different depending on what youre using the test for. For instance, in the cards example my null hypothesis was that all the four suit probabilities were identical (i.e., \\(P_1 = P_2 = P_3 = P_4 = 0.25\\)), but theres nothing special about that hypothesis. I could just as easily have tested the null hypothesis that \\(P_1 = 0.7\\) and \\(P_2 = P_3 = P_4 = 0.1\\) using a goodness-of-fit test. So its helpful to the reader if you explain to them what your null hypothesis was. Also, notice that I described the null hypothesis in words, not in maths. Thats perfectly acceptable. You can describe it in maths if you like, but since most readers find words easier to read than symbols, most writers tend to describe the null using words if they can. {}. When reporting the results of the test itself, I didnt just say that the result was significant, I included a stat block (i.e., the dense mathematical-looking part in the parentheses) which reports all the key statistical information. For the chi-square goodness-of-fit test, the information that gets reported is the test statistic (that the goodness-of-fit statistic was 8.44), the information about the distribution used in the test (\\(\\chi^2\\) with 3 degrees of freedom which is usually shortened to \\(\\chi^2(3)\\)), and then the information about whether the result was significant (in this case \\(p&lt;.05\\)). The particular information that needs to go into the stat block is different for every test, and so each time I introduce a new test Ill show you what the stat block should look like.66 However the general principle is that you should always provide enough information so that the reader could check the test results themselves if they really wanted to. {}. In addition to indicating that the result was significant, I provided an interpretation of the result (i.e., that people didnt choose randomly). This is also a kindness to the reader, because it tells them something about what they should believe about whats going on in your data. If you dont include something like this, its really hard for your reader to understand whats going on.67 As with everything else, your overriding concern should be that you {} things to your reader. Always remember that the point of reporting your results is to communicate to another human being. I cannot tell you just how many times Ive seen the results section of a report or a thesis or even a scientific article that is just gibberish, because the writer has focused solely on making sure theyve included all the numbers and forgotten to actually communicate with the human reader. 10.1.10 A comment on statistical notation Satan delights equally in statistics and in quoting scripture  H.G. Wells If youve been reading very closely, and are as much of a mathematical pedant as I am, there is one thing about the way I wrote up the chi-square test in the last section that might be bugging you a little bit. Theres something that feels a bit wrong with writing \\(\\chi^2(3) = 8.44\\), you might be thinking. After all, its the goodness-of-fit statistic that is equal to 8.44, so shouldnt I have written \\(X^2 = 8.44\\) or maybe GOF\\(=8.44\\)? This seems to be conflating the {} (i.e., \\(\\chi^2\\) with \\(df = 3\\)) with the {} (i.e., \\(X^2\\)). Odds are you figured it was a typo, since \\(\\chi\\) and \\(X\\) look pretty similar. Oddly, its not. Writing \\(\\chi^2(3) = 8.44\\) is essentially a highly condensed way of writing the sampling distribution of the test statistic is \\(\\chi^2(3)\\), and the value of the test statistic is 8.44. In one sense, this is kind of stupid. There are lots of different test statistics out there that turn out to have a chi-square sampling distribution. The \\(X^2\\) statistic that weve used for our goodness-of-fit test is only one of many (albeit one of the most commonly encountered ones). In a sensible, perfectly organised world wed {} have a separate name for the test statistic and the sampling distribution. That way, the stat block itself would tell you exactly what it was that the researcher had calculated. Sometimes this happens. For instance, the test statistic used in the Pearson goodness-of-fit test is written \\(X^2\\), but theres a closely related test known as the \\(G\\)-test68 [Sokal and Rohlf (1994)}, in which the test statistic is written as \\(G\\). As it happens, the Pearson goodness-of-fit test and the \\(G\\)-test both test the same null hypothesis, and the sampling distribution is exactly the same (i.e., chi-square with \\(k-1\\) degrees of freedom). If Id done a \\(G\\)-test for the cards data rather than a goodness-of-fit test, then Id have ended up with a test statistic of \\(G = 8.65\\), which is slightly different from the \\(X^2 = 8.44\\) value that I got earlier and which produces a slightly smaller \\(p\\)-value of \\(p = .034\\). Suppose that the convention was to report the test statistic, then the sampling distribution, and then the \\(p\\)-value. If that were true, then these two situations would produce different stat blocks: my original result would be written \\(X^2 = 8.44, \\chi^2(3), p = .038\\), whereas the new version using the \\(G\\)-test would be written as \\(G = 8.65, \\chi^2(3), p = .034\\). However, using the condensed reporting standard, the original result is written \\(\\chi^2(3) = 8.44, p = .038\\), and the new one is written \\(\\chi^2(3) = 8.65, p = .034\\), and so its actually unclear which test I actually ran. So why dont we live in a world in which the contents of the stat block uniquely specifies what tests were ran? The deep reason is that life is messy. We (as users of statistical tools) want it to be nice and neat and organised. We want it to be designed, as if it were a product, but thats not how life works. Statistics is an intellectual discipline just as much as any other one, and as such its a massively distributed, partly-collaborative and partly-competitive project that no-one really understands completely. The things that you and I use as data analysis tools werent created by an Act of the Gods of Statistics. They were invented by lots of different people, published as papers in academic journals, implemented, corrected and modified by lots of other people, and then explained to students in textbooks by someone else. As a consequence, theres a lot of test statistics that dont even have names, and as a consequence theyre just given the same name as the corresponding sampling distribution. As well see later, any test statistic that follows a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is commonly called a chi-square statistic, anything that follows a \\(t\\)-distribution is called a \\(t\\)-statistic, and so on. But, as the \\(\\chi^2\\) versus \\(G\\) example illustrates, two different things with the same sampling distribution are still, well, different. As a consequence, its sometimes a good idea to be clear about what the actual test was that you ran, especially if youre doing something unusual. If you just say chi-square test its not actually clear what test youre talking about. Although, since the two most common chi-square tests are the goodness-of-fit test and the independence test (Section 10.2), most readers with stats training can probably guess. Nevertheless, its something to be aware of. 10.2 The \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence (or association) The other day I was watching an animated documentary examining the quaint customs of the natives of the planet Chapek 9. Apparently, in order to gain access to their capital city a visitor must prove that theyre a robot, not a human. In order to determine whether or not a visitor is human, the natives ask whether the visitor prefers puppies, flowers, or large, properly formatted data files. Pretty clever, I thought to myself but what if humans and robots have the same preferences? That probably wouldnt be a very good test then, would it? As it happens, I got my hands on the testing data that the civil authorities of Chapek 9 used to check this. It turns out that what they did was very simple. They found a bunch of robots and a bunch of humans and asked them what they preferred. I saved their data in a file called chapek9.omv, which we can now load into jamovi. As well as the ID variable that identifies individual people, there are two nominal text variables, species and choice. In total there are 180 entries in the data set, one for each person (counting both robots and humans as people) who was asked to make a choice. Specifically, there are 93 humans and 87 robots, and overwhelmingly the preferred choice is the data file. You can check this yourself by asking jamovi for Frequency Tables, under the Exploration - Descriptives button. However, this summary does not address the question were interested in. To do that, we need a more detailed description of the data. What we want to do is look at the choices broken down by species. That is, we need to cross-tabulate the data (see Section 6.1). In jamovi we do this using the Frequencies - Contingency Tables - Independent Samples analysis, and we should get a table something like this: From this, its quite clear that the vast majority of the humans chose the data file, whereas the robots tended to be a lot more even in their preferences. Leaving aside the question of why the humans might be more likely to choose the data file for the moment (which does seem quite odd, admittedly), our first order of business is to determine if the discrepancy between human choices and robot choices in the data set is statistically significant. 10.2.1 Constructing our hypothesis test} How do we analyse this data? Specifically, since my research hypothesis is that humans and robots answer the question in different ways, how can I construct a test of the null hypothesis that humans and robots answer the question the same way? As before, we begin by establishing some notation to describe the data: In this notation we say that \\(O_{ij}\\) is a count (observed frequency) of the number of respondents that are of species \\(j\\) (robots or human) who gave answer \\(i\\) (puppy, flower or data) when asked to make a choice. The total number of observations is written \\(N\\), as usual. Finally, Ive used \\(R_i\\) to denote the row totals (e.g., \\(R_1\\) is the total number of people who chose the flower), and \\(C_j\\) to denote the column totals (e.g., \\(C_1\\) is the total number of robots).^[A technical note. The way Ive described the test pretends that the column totals are fixed (i.e., the researcher intended to survey 87 robots and 93 humans) and the row totals are random (i.e., it just turned out that 28 people chose the puppy). To use the terminology from my mathematical statistics textbook (Hogg, McKean, and Craig 2005}, I should technically refer to this situation as a chi-square test of homogeneity and reserve the term chi-square test of independence for the situation where both the row and column totals are random outcomes of the experiment. In the initial drafts of this book thats exactly what I did. However, it turns out that these two tests are identical, and so Ive collapsed them together.) So now lets think about what the null hypothesis says. If robots and humans are responding in the same way to the question, it means that the probability that a robot says puppy is the same as the probability that a human says puppy, and so on for the other two possibilities. So, if we use \\(P_{ij}\\) to denote the probability that a member of species \\(j\\) gives response \\(i\\) then our null hypothesis is that: And actually, since the null hypothesis is claiming that the true choice probabilities dont depend on the species of the person making the choice, we can let \\(P_i\\) refer to this probability, e.g., \\(P_1\\) is the true probability of choosing the puppy. Next, in much the same way that we did with the goodness-of-fit test, what we need to do is calculate the expected frequencies. That is, for each of the observed counts \\(O_{ij}\\), we need to figure out what the null hypothesis would tell us to expect. Lets denote this expected frequency by \\(E_{ij}\\). This time, its a little bit trickier. If there are a total of \\(C_j\\) people that belong to species \\(j\\), and the true probability of anyone (regardless of species) choosing option \\(i\\) is \\(P_i\\), then the expected frequency is just: \\[ E_{ij} = C_j \\times P_i \\] Now, this is all very well and good, but we have a problem. Unlike the situation we had with the goodness-of-fit test, the null hypothesis doesnt actually specify a particular value for \\(P_i\\). Its something we have to estimate (Chapter @ref(estimation}) from the data! Fortunately, this is pretty easy to do. If 28 out of 180 people selected the flowers, then a natural estimate for the probability of choosing flowers is \\(28/180\\), which is approximately \\(.16\\). If we phrase this in mathematical terms, what were saying is that our estimate for the probability of choosing option \\(i\\) is just the row total divided by the total sample size: \\[ \\hat{P}_i = \\frac{R_i}{N} \\] Therefore, our expected frequency can be written as the product (i.e. multiplication) of the row total and the column total, divided by the total number of observations:69 \\[ E_{ij} = \\frac{R_i \\times C_j}{N} \\] Now that weve figured out how to calculate the expected frequencies, its straightforward to define a test statistic, following the exact same strategy that we used in the goodness-of-fit test. In fact, its pretty much the {} statistic. For a contingency table with \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns, the equation that defines our \\(X^2\\) statistic is \\[ X^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^r\\sum_{j=1}^c \\frac{({E}_{ij} - O_{ij})^2}{{E}_{ij}} \\] The only difference is that I have to include two summation signs (i.e., \\(\\sum\\)) to indicate that were summing over both rows and columns. As before, large values of \\(X^2\\) indicate that the null hypothesis provides a poor description of the data, whereas small values of \\(X^2\\) suggest that it does a good job of accounting for the data. Therefore, just like last time, we want to reject the null hypothesis if \\(X^2\\) is too large. Not surprisingly, this statistic is \\(\\chi^2\\) distributed. All we need to do is figure out how many degrees of freedom are involved, which actually isnt too hard. As I mentioned before, you can (usually) think of the degrees of freedom as being equal to the number of data points that youre analysing, minus the number of constraints. A contingency table with \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns contains a total of \\(r \\times c\\) observed frequencies, so thats the total number of observations. What about the constraints? Here, its slightly trickier. The answer is always the same \\[ df = (r-1)(c-1) \\] but the explanation for {} the degrees of freedom takes this value is different depending on the experimental design. For the sake of argument, lets suppose that we had honestly intended to survey exactly 87 robots and 93 humans (column totals fixed by the experimenter), but left the row totals free to vary (row totals are random variables). Lets think about the constraints that apply here. Well, since we deliberately fixed the column totals by Act of Experimenter, we have \\(c\\) constraints right there. But, theres actually more to it than that. Remember how our null hypothesis had some free parameters (i.e., we had to estimate the \\(P_i\\) values)? Those matter too. I wont explain why in this book, but every free parameter in the null hypothesis is rather like an additional constraint. So, how many of those are there? Well, since these probabilities have to sum to 1, theres only \\(r-1\\) of these. So our total degrees of freedom is: \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} df &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{(number of observations)} - \\mbox{(number of constraints)} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; (rc) - (c + (r-1)) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; rc - c - r + 1 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; (r - 1)(c - 1) \\end{array} \\] Alternatively, suppose that the only thing that the experimenter fixed was the total sample size \\(N\\). That is, we quizzed the first 180 people that we saw and it just turned out that 87 were robots and 93 were humans. This time around our reasoning would be slightly different, but would still lead us to the same answer. Our null hypothesis still has \\(r-1\\) free parameters corresponding to the choice probabilities, but it now also has \\(c-1\\) free parameters corresponding to the species probabilities, because wed also have to estimate the probability that a randomly sampled person turns out to be a robot.70 Finally, since we did actually fix the total number of observations \\(N\\), thats one more constraint. So, now we have \\(rc\\) observations, and \\((c-1) + (r-1) + 1\\) constraints. What does that give? \\[ \\begin{array}{rcl} df &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{(number of observations)} - \\mbox{(number of constraints)} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; rc - ( (c-1) + (r-1) + 1) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; rc - c - r + 1 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; (r - 1)(c - 1) \\end{array} \\] Amazing. 10.2.2 Doing the test in jamovi} Okay, now that we know how the test works lets have a look at how its done in jamovi. As tempting as it is to lead you through the tedious calculations so that youre forced to learn it the long way, I figure theres no point. I already showed you how to do it the long way for the goodness-of-fit test in the last section, and since the test of independence isnt conceptually any different, you wont learn anything new by doing it the long way. So instead Ill go straight to showing you the easy way. After you have run the test in jamovi (Frequencies - Contingency Tables - Independent Samples), all you have to do is look underneath the contingency table in the jamovi results window and there is the \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic for you. This shows a \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic value of 10.72, with 2 d.f. and \\(p\\)-value = 0.005. That was easy, wasnt it! You can also ask jamovi to show you the expected counts - just click on the check box for Counts' -Expected in the Cells' options and the expected counts will appear in the contingency table. And whilst you are doing that, an effect size measure would be helpful. We'll choose Cramer's V, and you can specify this from a check box in theStatistics options, and it gives a value for Cramers V of 0.24. We will talk about this some more in just a moment. This output gives us enough information to write up the result: Notice that, once again, I provided a little bit of interpretation to help the human reader understand whats going on with the data. Later on in my discussion section Id provide a bit more context. To illustrate the difference, heres what Id probably say later on: This could be classified as a rather extreme example of a reactivity effect, I suppose. Obviously, in this case the problem is severe enough that the study is more or less worthless as a tool for understanding the difference preferences among humans and robots. However, I hope this illustrates the difference between getting a statistically significant result (our null hypothesis is rejected in favour of the alternative), and finding something of scientific value (the data tell us nothing of interest about our research hypothesis due to a big methodological flaw). 10.2.3 Postscript} I later found out the data were made up, and Id been watching cartoons instead of doing work. Okay, time for a little bit of a digression. Ive been lying to you a little bit so far. Theres a tiny change that you need to make to your calculations whenever you only have 1 degree of freedom. Its called the continuity correction, or sometimes the Yates correction. Remember what I pointed out earlier: the \\(\\chi^2\\) test is based on an approximation, specifically on the assumption that the binomial distribution starts to look like a normal distribution for large \\(N\\). One problem with this is that it often doesnt quite work, especially when youve only got 1 degree of freedom (e.g., when youre doing a test of independence on a \\(2 \\times 2\\) contingency table). The main reason for this is that the true sampling distribution for the \\(X^2\\) statistic is actually discrete (because youre dealing with categorical data!) but the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is continuous. This can introduce systematic problems. Specifically, when \\(N\\) is small and when \\(df=1\\), the goodness-of-fit statistic tends to be too big, meaning that you actually have a bigger \\(\\alpha\\) value than you think (or, equivalently, the \\(p\\) values are a bit too small). Yates (1934) suggested a simple fix, in which you redefine the goodness-of-fit statistic as: \\[ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(|E_i - O_i| - 0.5)^2}{E_i} \\] Basically, he just subtracts off 0.5 everywhere. As far as I can tell from reading Yates paper, the correction is basically a hack. Its not derived from any principled theory. Rather, its based on an examination of the behaviour of the test, and observing that the corrected version seems to work better. You can specify this correction in jamovi from a check box in the Statistics options, where it is called `\\(\\chi^2\\) continuity correction. 10.3 Effect size As we discussed earlier (Section @ref(effectsize}), its becoming commonplace to ask researchers to report some measure of effect size. So, lets suppose that youve run your chi-square test, which turns out to be significant. So you now know that there is some association between your variables (independence test) or some deviation from the specified probabilities (goodness-of-fit test). Now you want to report a measure of effect size. That is, given that there is an association or deviation, how strong is it? There are several different measures that you can choose to report, and several different tools that you can use to calculate them. I wont discuss all of them but will instead focus on the most commonly reported measures of effect size. By default, the two measures that people tend to report most frequently are the \\(\\phi\\) statistic and the somewhat superior version, known as Cramers \\(V\\). Mathematically, theyre very simple. To calculate the \\(\\phi\\) statistic, you just divide your \\(X^2\\) value by the sample size, and take the square root: \\[ \\phi = \\sqrt{\\frac{X^2}{N}} \\] The idea here is that the \\(\\phi\\) statistic is supposed to range between 0 (no association at all) and 1 (perfect association), but it doesnt always do this when your contingency table is bigger than \\(2 \\times 2\\), which is a total pain. For bigger tables its actually possible to obtain \\(\\phi&gt;1\\), which is pretty unsatisfactory. So, to correct for this, people usually prefer to report the \\(V\\) statistic proposed by Cramer (1946). Its a pretty simple adjustment to \\(\\phi\\). If youve got a contingency table with \\(r\\) rows and \\(c\\) columns, then define \\(k = \\min(r,c)\\) to be the smaller of the two values. If so, then Cramers \\(V\\) statistic is \\[ V = \\sqrt{\\frac{X^2}{N(k-1)}} \\] And youre done. This seems to be a fairly popular measure, presumably because its easy to calculate, and it gives answers that arent completely silly. With Cramers V, you know that the value really does range from 0 (no association at all) to 1 (perfect association). All statistical tests make assumptions, and its usually a good idea to check that those assumptions are met. For the chi-square tests discussed so far in this chapter, the assumptions are: {}. Remember how in the previous section we saw that the \\(\\chi^2\\) sampling distribution emerges because the binomial distribution is pretty similar to a normal distribution? Well, like we discussed in Chapter @ref(probability} this is only true when the number of observations is sufficiently large. What that means in practice is that all of the expected frequencies need to be reasonably big. How big is reasonably big? Opinions differ, but the default assumption seems to be that you generally would like to see all your expected frequencies larger than about 5, though for larger tables you would probably be okay if at least 80% of the the expected frequencies are above 5 and none of them are below 1. However, from what Ive been able to discover these seem to have been proposed as rough guidelines, not hard and fast rules, and they seem to be somewhat conservative [Larntz (1978)}. {}. One somewhat hidden assumption of the chi-square test is that you have to genuinely believe that the observations are independent. Heres what I mean. Suppose Im interested in proportion of babies born at a particular hospital that are boys. I walk around the maternity wards and observe 20 girls and only 10 boys. Seems like a pretty convincing difference, right? But later on, it turns out that Id actually walked into the same ward 10 times and in fact Id only seen 2 girls and 1 boy. Not as convincing, is it? My original 30 {} were massively non-independent, and were only in fact equivalent to 3 independent observations. Obviously this is an extreme (and extremely silly) example, but it illustrates the basic issue. Non-independence stuffs things up. Sometimes it causes you to falsely reject the null, as the silly hospital example illustrates, but it can go the other way too. To give a slightly less stupid example, lets consider what would happen if Id done the cards experiment slightly differently Instead of asking 200 people to try to imagine sampling one card at random, suppose I asked 50 people to select 4 cards. One possibility would be that {} selects one heart, one club, one diamond and one spade (in keeping with the representativeness heuristic; . This is highly non-random behaviour from people, but in this case I would get an observed frequency of 50 for all four suits. For this example the fact that the observations are non-independent (because the four cards that you pick will be related to each other) actually leads to the opposite effect, falsely retaining the null. \\end{itemize} If you happen to find yourself in a situation where independence is violated, it may be possible to use the McNemar test (which well discuss) or the Cochran test (which we wont). Similarly, if your expected cell counts are too small, check out the Fisher exact test. It is to these topics that we now turn. 10.4 The Fisher exact test What should you do if your cell counts are too small, but youd still like to test the null hypothesis that the two variables are independent? One answer would be collect more data, but thats far too glib There are a lot of situations in which it would be either infeasible or unethical do that. If so, statisticians have a kind of moral obligation to provide scientists with better tests. In this instance, Fisher (1922a) kindly provided the right answer to the question. To illustrate the basic idea lets suppose that were analysing data from a field experiment looking at the emotional status of people who have been accused of Witchcraft, some of whom are currently being burned at the stake.71 Unfortunately for the scientist (but rather fortunately for the general populace), its actually quite hard to find people in the process of being set on fire, so the cell counts are awfully small in some cases. A contingency table of the salem.csv data illustrates the point: on.fire happy FALSE TRUE FALSE 3 3 TRUE 10 0 Looking at this data, youd be hard pressed not to suspect that people not on fire are more likely to be happy than people on fire. However, the chi-square test makes this very hard to test because of the small sample size. So, speaking as someone who doesnt want to be set on fire, Id {} like to be able to get a better answer than this. This is where Fishers exact test [Fisher (1922a)} comes in very handy. The Fisher exact test works somewhat differently to the chi-square test (or in fact any of the other hypothesis tests that I talk about in this book) insofar as it doesnt have a test statistic, but it calculates the \\(p\\)-value directly. Ill explain the basics of how the test works for a \\(2 \\times 2\\) contingency table. As before, lets have some notation: In order to construct the test Fisher treats both the row and column totals (\\(R_1\\), \\(R_2\\), \\(C_1\\) and \\(C_2\\)) as known, fixed quantities and then calculates the probability that we would have obtained the observed frequencies that we did (\\(O_{11}\\), \\(O_{12}\\), \\(O_{21}\\) and \\(O_{22}\\)) given those totals. In the notation that we developed in Chapter @ref(probability} this is written: \\[ P(O_{11}, O_{12}, O_{21}, O_{22} \\ | \\ R_1, R_2, C_1, C_2) \\] and as you might imagine, its a slightly tricky exercise to figure out what this probability is. But it turns out that this probability is described by a distribution known as the {}. What we have to do to calculate our \\(p\\)-value is calculate the probability of observing this particular table {}.72 Back in the 1920s, computing this sum was daunting even in the simplest of situations, but these days its pretty easy as long as the tables arent too big and the sample size isnt too large. The conceptually tricky issue is to figure out what it means to say that one contingency table is more extreme than another. The easiest solution is to say that the table with the lowest probability is the most extreme. This then gives us the \\(p\\)-value. You can specify this test in jamovi from a check box in the Statistics' options of theContingency Tables analysis. When you do this with the data from the salem.csv file, the Fisher exact test statistic is shown in the results. The main thing were interested in here is the \\(p\\)-value, which in this case is small enough (\\(p=.036\\)) to justify rejecting the null hypothesis that people on fire are just as happy as people not on fire. See Figure ??. Suppose youve been hired to work for the {} (AGPP), and part of your job is to find out how effective the AGPP political advertisements are. So you decide to put together a sample of N = 100 people and ask them to watch the AGPP ads. Before they see anything, you ask them if they intend to vote for the AGPP, and then after showing the ads you ask them again to see if anyone has changed their minds. Obviously, if youre any good at your job, youd also do a whole lot of other things too, but lets consider just this one simple experiment. One way to describe your data is via the following contingency table: At first pass, you might think that this situation lends itself to the Pearson \\(\\chi^2\\) test of independence (as per Section @ref(chisqindependence}). However, a little bit of thought reveals that weve got a problem. We have 100 participants but 200 observations. This is because each person has provided us with an answer in {} the before column and the after column. What this means is that the 200 observations arent independent of each other. If voter A says yes the first time and voter B says no, then youd expect that voter A is more likely to say yes the second time than voter B! The consequence of this is that the usual \\(\\chi^2\\) test wont give trustworthy answers due to the violation of the independence assumption. Now, if this were a really uncommon situation, I wouldnt be bothering to waste your time talking about it. But its not uncommon at all. This is a {} repeated measures design, and none of the tests weve considered so far can handle it. Eek. The solution to the problem was published by . The trick is to start by tabulating your data in a slightly different way: This is exactly the same data, but its been rewritten so that each of our 100 participants appears in only one cell. Because weve written our data this way the independence assumption is now satisfied, and this is a contingency table that we {} use to construct a \\(\\chi^2\\) goodness-of-fit statistic. However, as well see, we need to do it in a slightly non-standard way. To see whats going on, it helps to label the entries in our table a little differently: Next, lets think about what our null hypothesis is: its that the before test and the after test have the same proportion of people saying Yes, I will vote for AGPP. Because of the way that we have rewritten the data, it means that were now testing the hypothesis that the {} and {} come from the same distribution. Thus, the null hypothesis in McNemars test is that we have marginal homogeneity. That is, the row totals and column totals have the same distribution: \\(P_a + P_b = P_a + P_c\\) and similarly that \\(P_c + P_d = P_b + P_d\\). Notice that this means that the null hypothesis actually simplifies to \\(P_b = P_c\\). In other words, as far as the McNemar test is concerned, its only the off-diagonal entries in this table (i.e., \\(b\\) and \\(c\\)) that matter! After noticing this, the McNemar test of marginal homogeneity is no different to a usual \\(\\chi^2\\) test. After applying the Yates correction, our test statistic becomes: \\[ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(|b-c| - 0.5)^2}{b+c} \\] or, to revert to the notation that we used earlier in this chapter: \\[ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(|O_{12}-O_{21}| - 0.5)^2}{O_{12} + O_{21}} \\] and this statistic has a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution (approximately) with \\(df=1\\). However, remember that just like the other \\(\\chi^2\\) tests its only an approximation, so you need to have reasonably large expected cell counts for it to work. 10.4.1 Doing the McNemar test in jamovi} Now that you know what the McNemar test is all about, lets actually run one. The file contains the raw data that I discussed previously. The agpp} data set contains three variables, anid} variable that labels each participant in the data set (well see why thats useful in a moment), a #response_before# variable that records the persons answer when they were asked the question the first time, and a #response_after# variable that shows the answer that they gave when asked the same question a second time. Notice that each participant appears only once in this data set. Go to the Analyses' -Frequencies - Contingency Tables' -Paired Samples analysis in jamovi, and move #response_before# into the Rows' box, and \\rtextverb#response_after# into theColumns box. You will then get a contingency table in the results window, with the statistic for the McNemar test just below it, see Figure And were done. Weve just run a McNemars test to determine if people were just as likely to vote AGPP after the ads as they were before hand. The test was significant (\\(\\chi^2(1) = 12.03, p&lt;.001\\)), suggesting that they were not. And, in fact it looks like the ads had a negative effect: people were less likely to vote AGPP after seeing the ads. Which makes a lot of sense when you consider the quality of a typical political advertisement. Lets go all the way back to the beginning of the chapter and look at the `cards} data set again. If you recall, the actual experimental design that I described involved people making {} choices. Because we have information about the first choice and the second choice that everyone made, we can construct the following contingency table that cross-tabulates the first choice against the second choice. choice_2 choice_1 clubs diamonds hearts spades clubs 10 9 10 6 diamonds 20 4 13 14 hearts 20 18 3 23 spades 18 13 15 4 Suppose I wanted to know whether the choice you make the second time is dependent on the choice you made the first time. This is where a test of independence is useful, and what were trying to do is see if theres some relationship between the rows and columns of this table. Alternatively, suppose I wanted to know if {}, the frequencies of suit choices were different the second time than the first time. In that situation, what Im really trying to see is if the row totals are different from the column totals. Thats when you use the McNemar test. The different statistics produced by these different analyses are shown in Figure . Notice that the results are different! These arent the same test. The key ideas discussed in this chapter are: The \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) goodness-of-fit test (Section @ref(goftest}) is used when you have a table of observed frequencies of different categories, and the null hypothesis gives you a set of known probabilities to compare them to. The \\(\\chi^2\\) (chi-square) test of independence (Section @ref(chisqindependence}) is used when you have a contingency table (cross-tabulation) of two categorical variables. The null hypothesis is that there is no relationship or association between the variables. Effect size for a contingency table can be measured in several ways (Section @ref(chisqeffectsize}). In particular we noted the Cram'ers \\(V\\) statistic. Both versions of the Pearson test rely on two assumptions: that the expected frequencies are sufficiently large, and that the observations are independent (Section @ref(chisqassumptions}). The Fisher exact test (Section @ref(fisherexacttest}) can be used when the expected frequencies are small. The McNemar test (Section @ref(mcnemar}) can be used for some kinds of violations of independence. \\end{itemize} If youre interested in learning more about categorical data analysis a good first choice would be which, as the title suggests, provides an {}. If the introductory book isnt enough for you (or cant solve the problem youre working on) you could consider , {}. The latter is a more advanced text, so its probably not wise to jump straight from this book to that one.
